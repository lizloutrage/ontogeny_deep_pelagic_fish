  abstract = {The depth distribution of a major marine biomass component is determined by variation in water clarity.           ,              The deep scattering layer (DSL) is a ubiquitous acoustic signature found across all oceans and arguably the dominant feature structuring the pelagic open ocean ecosystem. It is formed by mesopelagic fishes and pelagic invertebrates. The DSL animals are an important food source for marine megafauna and contribute to the biological carbon pump through the active flux of organic carbon transported in their daily vertical migrations. They occupy depths from 200 to 1000 m at daytime and migrate to a varying degree into surface waters at nighttime. Their daytime depth, which determines the migration amplitude, varies across the global ocean in concert with water mass properties, in particular the oxygen regime, but the causal underpinning of these correlations has been unclear. We present evidence that the broad variability in the oceanic DSL daytime depth observed during the Malaspina 2010 Circumnavigation Expedition is governed by variation in light penetration. We find that the DSL depth distribution conforms to a common optical depth layer across the global ocean and that a correlation between dissolved oxygen and light penetration provides a parsimonious explanation for the association of shallow DSL distributions with hypoxic waters. In enhancing understanding of this phenomenon, our results should improve the ability to predict and model the dynamics of one of the largest animal biomass components on earth, with key roles in the oceanic biological carbon pump and food web.},

This gap limits the understanding of these communities and their ecological relationships with other chemosynthetic ecosystems, such as vents and seeps. Here, we studied 3 different whale skeleton microhabitats with hypothesized high, intermediate and low reducing conditions as well as the sediments surrounding an abyssal whale fall (4204 m depth, SW Atlantic Ocean). We analyzed trophic structures ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) and the contribution of chemosynthetically derived carbon to heterotrophic species. The high and intermediate reducing microhabitats harbored food webs dominated by consumers of chemosynthetic production, similar to those of diffusive areas of hydrothermal vents and seeps. Both the low reducing microhabitat and the sediments harbored food webs with greater trophic complexity, dominated by higher consumers mainly relying on whale and/or photosynthesis-derived organic matter, a type of food web commonly reported in small whale, wood and kelp falls. The main whale-fall ecosystem engineer, the bone-eating worm Osedax, appeared to produce unique food web effects not observed in other chemosynthetic habitats. We conclude that whale falls provide the deep sea with a mosaic of microhabitats that supports assemblages with different chemosynthesis reliance levels and trophic structures, similar to those found at vents and seeps. Such a mosaic allows species-rich communities with numerous trophic levels to develop in a very small area of the food-limited deep sea.},

  abstract = {Isolated and fragmented nascent hydrothermal vent sites are rapidly colonized by a regional pool of species. However, colonization processes are complex and depend on several interacting biotic and abiotic factors playing at different scales. Furthermore, reducing habitats, such as sunken woods or whale carcasses, may be used by some hydrothermal vent fauna as dispersal stepping stones. Here, we studied macrofaunal communities colonizing wood and slate substrata deployed during two years (2013-2015) at 5 sites of varying hydrothermal activity (from high to non-active) on the Lucky Strike vent field (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). Our objective was to shed light on how environmental characteristics, substratum type and biotic factors influence vent colonization processes. We hypothesized that environmental filtering largely drives community composition and structure at sites characterized by the presence of hydrothermal vent activity, whereas other factors take over at external sites. A redundancy analyses (RDA) model supported our hypothesis and showed that vent fluid inputs strongly drove assemblage structure at active sites regardless of substratum type, whereas this parameter played a stronger role at inactive sites. The assemblages of active site substrata were mainly characterized by regular vent inhabitants, while wood at inactive sites created a typical ``wood-fall'' assemblage. Slate assemblages at inactive sites where a subset of their counterparts at active sites. Hydrothermal vent species, such as Amphisamytha lutzi and Bathymodiolus azoricus, did not colonize external site substrata, supporting their strong reliance on hydrothermal vent conditions. Finally, we coupled traditional taxonomic approaches with trophic structure and functional trait analyses to further clarify the role of biotic interactions on colonization processes. Characterizing such ecological aspects of vent ecosystem is critical to be able to elaborate management strategies to mitigate the future impacts of anthropogenic activities such as deep-sea mining.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Increasingly, researchers are using innovative methods to census marine life, including identification of environmental DNA (eDNA) left behind by organisms in the water column. However, little is understood about how eDNA is distributed in the ocean, given that organisms are mobile and that physical and biological processes can transport eDNA after release from a host. Particularly in the vast mesopelagic ocean where many species vertically migrate hundreds of meters diurnally, it is important to link the location at which eDNA was shed by a host organism to the location at which eDNA was collected in a water sample. Here, we present a one-dimensional mechanistic model to simulate the eDNA vertical distribution after its release and to compare the impact of key biological and physical parameters on the eDNA vertical and temporal distribution. The modeled vertical eDNA profiles allow us to quantify spatial and temporal variability in eDNA concentration and to identify the most important parameters to consider when interpreting eDNA signals. We find that the vertical displacement by advection, dispersion, and settling has limited influence on the eDNA distribution, and the depth at which eDNA is found is generally within tens of meters of the depth at which the eDNA was originally shed from the organism. Thus, using information about representative vertical migration patterns, eDNA concentration variability can be used to answer ecological questions about migrating organisms such as what depths species can be found in the daytime and nighttime and what percentage of individuals within a species diurnally migrate. These findings are critical both to advance the understanding of the vertical distribution of eDNA in the water column and to link eDNA detection to organism presence in the mesopelagic ocean as well as other aquatic environments.},

  author = {Alves, D{\'a}rio Mendes},
  abstract = {Analysis of video recordings performed by the submersible ``Nautile'' in the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic indicated that demersal fish species are associated to different types of deep-sea habitats. Four different dive transects were analysed with respect to environmental characteristics. A total of 19 fish groups were ordinated by means of canonical correspondence analysis, and the investigation was performed at the individual fish level. Microhabitat fauna was dominated by a diversity of suspension feeders indicating different gradients of bottom hydrology, particularly vertical and horizontal current flow. Physical, geological and biological factors revealed different strategies of habitat selection in fish. The most represented species, the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) showed a clear association with complex bottoms, including coral reefs. Others, such as Coryphaenoides rupestris and Synaphobranchus kaupi, showed higher flexibility of adjustment to changing environments. These traits can be utilised in the study of the environmental impact of deep-sea fishing. Based on the same dives, the locomotory behaviour of 13 fish species was studied with basis on a qualitative analysis of selected individuals. The main swimming modes used in shallow waters were also detected in the demersal environment. Clear differences in locomotory behaviour were found among fish species, reflecting both convergence and diversity of strategies of utilization of the demersal niche space.},

  abstract = {An ecosystem-based flow analysis model was used to study carbon transfer from primary production (PP) to mesopelagic fish via three groups of copepods: detritivores that access sinking particles, vertical migrators, and species that reside in the surface ocean. The model was parameterized for 40 S to 40 N in the world ocean such that results can be compared with recent estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass in this latitudinal range, based on field studies using acoustic technologies, of \$13 Gt (wet weight). Mesopelagic fish production was predicted to be 0.32\% of PP which, assuming fish longevity of 1.5 years, gives rise to predicted mesopelagic fish biomass of 2.4 Gt. Model ensembles were run to analyse the uncertainty of this estimate, with results showing predicted biomass {$>$}10 Gt in only 8\% of the simulations. The work emphasizes the importance of migrating animals in transferring carbon from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic zone. It also highlights how little is known about the physiological ecology of mesopelagic fish, trophic pathways within the mesopelagic food web, and how these link to PP in the surface ocean. A deeper understanding of these interacting factors is required before the potential for utilizing mesopelagic fish as a harvestable resource can be robustly assessed.},

Mesopelagic micronekton performed diel vertical migrations in both provinces, from deep (400\textendash 740 m) to surface (0\textendash 200 m) layers at dusk and in the opposite direction at dawn, with some species migrating below 740 m. The EAFR province was more dynamic than the oligotrophic ISSG province, with enhanced eddy activity and enhanced yearly productivity. The active enrichment mechanisms in the EAFR, in terms of available primary production, led to high micronekton acoustic density (as a proxy of micronekton abundance) and large micronekton weight and abundance estimates from trawl data. Particulate organic matter in the EAFR exhibited greater enrichment in 13C and 15N compared to the ISSG and, consequently, tissues of selected micronekton organisms in the EAFR were more enriched in 15N (higher {$\delta$}15N values). In both provinces, micronekton encompassed a wide range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps between species. Micronekton and swordfish in the EAFR had an overlapping range of {$\delta$}15N values, contrasting with the ISSG province where swordfish were two trophic levels higher than the sampled micronekton. Our results provide some evidence that the combined action of riverine input and the dynamics of eddies might influence productivity in the EAFR, and hence the abundance of micronekton and the enrichment of tissues in 15N, compared to the oligotrophic ISSG province.},

Results showed that the co-occurrence patterns of top predators and prey were driven by a combination of environmental and biotic factors, which highlighted the importance of considering both components to fully understand the community structure. In addition, results also revealed that many biotic interactions, such as schooling in prey (e.g. anchovy\textendash sardine), local enhancement/facilitation in predators (e.g. Cory's shearwater\textendash fin whale), and predation between predator\textendash prey species (e.g. northern gannet\textendash horse mackerel), were led by positive associations, although predator avoidance behaviour was also suggested between negatively associated species (e.g. striped dolphin\textendash blue whiting).

Taken together, the observations of the EPR between 17\textdegree S and 19\textdegree S from the 1993 NAUDUR cruise (a French acronym for Nautile on Ultra-fast Ridge) indicate recent volcanic eruptions occurring as frequently as every few years.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a comparison between Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Agassiz trawling methods for sampling deep-water fauna in three submarine canyons of the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea and describe the behavioural reactions of fishes and crustacean decapods to ROV approach. 10 ROV dives, where 3583 individuals were observed and identified to species level, and 8 Agassiz trawls were carried out in a depth range of 750\textendash 1500 m. As noticed in previous studies, abundances of fishes and decapod crustaceans were much higher in the ROV videos than in Agassiz trawl samples, as the latter are designed for the retrieval of benthic, less motile species in permanent contact with the bottom. In our observations fish abundance was one order of magnitude higher with ROV (4110.22 ind/km2) than with Agassiz trawl (350.88 ind/km2), whereas decapod crustaceans were six times more abundant in ROV videos (6362.40 ind/km2) than in Agassiz samples (1364.52 ind/km2).},

  abstract = {The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna, kilometres deep in the oceans, is a great achievement of 20th-century marine biology. The deep-sea hydrothermal food web does not directly depend on the sun's energy. Vent communities rely primarily on trophic associations between chemoautotrophic bacteria and consumers A small. number of endemic taxa are adapted to the inhospitable vent environments that are distributed along ridge crests. Where these vent communities originated and how they dispersed are among the important questions ecologists must answer. Here, by statistical analysis of the most comprehensive database ever assembled about deep-sea hydrothermal fauna, we delineate six major hydrothermal provinces in the world ocean and identify seven possible dispersal pathways between adjacent provinces. Our model suggests that the East-Pacific Rise may have played a pivotal role as a centre of dispersal for the hydrothermal fauna. Our data-driven conclusion will have to be tested by phylogenetic studies and completed by surveys of less-explored fields. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {This paper is the first of a series describing the vertical distribution of midwater fishes in the eastern North Atlantic in areas approximately 10\textdegree{} of latitude apart near the 20\textdegree{} meridian. As such, it is concerned solely with collections made in 30\textdegree N, 23\textdegree W. The results are based primarily upon RMT 8 net samples collected using an opening-closing RMT 1+ 8 combination net. In all, 17,443 specimens were caught by RMT 8, divisible into 37 families, 66 genera with 98 species identified. Numerically the most abundant groups recognized were the Gonostomatidae (60\textasciitilde o total catch), Maerorhamphosidae (23 Yo)and Myctophidae (7 \textasciitilde/o). Some definition of vertical limits is provided for the majority of species represented, but only 31 are considered in detail. Where possible, observed biological phenomena (e.g. development, sexual maturity, sexual dimorphism, etc.) and distribution limits have been correlated. In general, the characteristics of species' distributions, and the observed relations of distribution and migratory behaviour were as one would anticipate from past work. Among many species, a size-depth stratification was observed, and with migrants, migratory behaviour appeared dependent upon developmental state. The mode of species development, however, had no bearing upon ultimate migratory behaviour. Certain non-migratory elements of the population of an habitually migrant species, e.g. Chauliodus danae, could not be satisfactorily interpreted upon the basis of biological factors examined. Migrant species principally occupied 400-900 m depth by day, and 25-300 m by night, although they occurred at greater depths. Reverse migrations were only observed in Macrorhamphosus. The overall catches were dominated by non-migrants, and at depths greater than 200 m these comprised the most abundant species per depth at all times. Cydothone constituted the most abundant genus sampled and provided greatest insight into distributional and biological detail. C. braueri, the most numerous species, is probably a single spawner, and the results demonstrate a size-depth stratification that may be correlated with sexual maturity stages. The olfactory structure in males is more complicated than previously described. The larger males develop a snout prolongation which would improve water flow through the nasal rosette and hence olfaction. Unlike C. microdon, C. braueri probably does not undergo sex-reversaL Developmental notes are included for the myctophid species Notoscopelus resplendens, Benthosema suborbitale, and Hygophum hygomi in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {In the family Alepocephalidae there are               ca               . 19 valid genera (Markle, personal communication). Whilst luminescence has never been observed, there are four genera,               Xenodermichthys, Photostylus, Rouleina               and               Microphotolepis               , which contain species bearing structures that have been interpreted anatomically as photophores (Herring \& Morin, 1978). Among these four there is a remarkable diversity of photophore structure. The photophores of               Xenodermichthys               and               Photostylus               are similar in having well developed central cores (reddish violet in               Xenodermichthys               ) and reflector layers, yet those of               Xenodermichthys               are sessile whilst those of               Photostylus               are borne on stalks (e.g. von Lendenfeld, 1887; Best \& Bone, 1976). Not all species of               Rouleina               have light organs but where they are present they are sessile. Photophore structure of               Rouleina               has been examined only in               R. maderensis               Maul and was found there to be rather degenerate in adults (Markle, 1978). The light organs of               Microphotolepis multipunctata               Sazanov and Parin differ yet again in being scale covered, which contrasts with the naked photophores in the other three genera (Sazanov \& Parin, 1977). The abundance and distribution of photophores in adults also varies with genus and species. Thus in               Microphotolepis               and               Xenodermichthys               they are extremely numerous and regularly arranged but in               Photostylus               they are few and less ordered (G\"unther, 1887; Beebe, 1933; Sazanov \& Parin, 1977). In different species of               Rouleina               photophores may be relatively abundant and regularly arranged or few in number without such regular pattern (Maul, 1948; Uyeno \& Kishida, 1977; Markle, 1978).},

Yet, we still know little about the factors that affect deep-sea fish distributions and assemblage patterns on relatively small spatial scales. We used results from remotely operated vehicle surveys that observed 105 km ( \$ 346 960 m2) of seafloor over a depth range of 351\textendash 2245 m in three canyons off Newfoundland to examine the occurrence, behavior, habitat specificity, and regional assemblage patterns of deepsea fishes in this region. We found distinct assemblages based on both depth and habitat classifications. The most obvious unique assemblage was that associated with outcrops, which served as habitat for relatively rare species such as Neocyttus helgae, Hoplostethus atlanticus, and Lepidion eques. Several coral habitats hosted distinct assemblages when compared to other habitats with low or medium structural complexity. Our results illustrate that any program targeted at protecting deep-sea ecosystems must protect a wide-range of habitats and depths to conserve a variety of fish species and assemblages.},

Improved quantification of these relationships and their response to the environment is needed to parameterize food web models and describe food web structure and function. A compiled data set comprising 29 582 records of individual prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10 orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the influence of predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator\textendash prey mass ratios (PPMR) increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied among locations and predator species and individuals but was not significantly influenced by temperature, latitude, depth, or primary production. Increases in PPMR with predator mass implied nonlinear relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in transfer efficiency with increasing body size. The results suggest that very general rules determine dominant trends in PPMR in diverse marine ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic structuring and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative abundance of individuals and their body size.},

There are reasonably clear-cut faunal assemblages with characteristic species. The geographic ranges of the assemblages conform to those patterns shown by zooplankton. As part of a 5 yr (August 1969-March 1974), seven-cruise, ecological study, replicate sampling in central gyral waters included additional quantitative sampling at a point along the equator at 155 \textasciitilde{} to compare species composition and structure at this location with points in the central gyres. These comparisons show that the distribution of individuals among species displays similar structure in all three areas, but species composition and the relative abundances of shared species differ. There are species restricted to the low-productivity central gyres, and subgroups of these are restricted to specific gyres. The gyral faunas differ markedly from the high-productivity species assemblage found along the equator. With the exception of the eastern tropical Pacific, where low oxygen concentrations probably limit species distributions, the primary productivity regime is the most likely factor defining the distributions of most mesopelagic fishes in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. The mechanisms for the maintenance of these geographic patterns are not clear, but the correlation of the patterns with the productivity regime leads one to hypothesize that the ultimate factor is food.},

Both gyres were rich in mesopelagic fish species (228 and 144 were identified in the north and in the south, respectively). Species composition differed between the north and in the south in some details, which are discussed. A typical trawl sample contained 30 to 50 species, of which 5 or fewer accounted for over half of the individuals; this marked dominance tended to increase with sample size. By several statistical measures of community structure, species composition of fish assemblages in both gyres was shown to remain nearly constant within and between years, the only significant variations being in biomass from one year to the next. The results as a whole indicate that the central gyres show no evidence of advective processes influencing community structure. All important processes evidently take place in situ, suggesting that the gyres can be considered self-regulated and semi-closed ecosystems with a high degree of biological regulation.},

Differences in diet depending on fish size and time (daylight and night) were also checked by statistical analysis. D. metopoclampus is a zooplanktivorous predator, consuming mainly Crustacea, but also Mollusca, Polychaeta, Chaetognatha, Taliacea and Actinopterygii, and showing a moderate opportunistic feeding strategy. D. metopoclampus can be ascribed to the group of acyclic predators, since it seems to be a non-migrator myctophid that feeds when prey are available. Statistical analysis indicated a size-related shift in the diet of D. metopoclampus from smaller prey organisms (e.g, Metridinidae) to larger ones (e.g, Euphausiidae and Myctophidae). Some differences in prey composition between daylight and night were highlighted: euphausiids and myctophids were more abundant during night, Metridinidae during daylight.},

Overall 206 individuals (64.0\textendash 260.0 mm SL) were collected from 2013 to 2015. C. sloani can be defined a specialist predator which feeds exclusively on mesopelagic fish belonging to Gonostomatidae, Myctophidae, Paralepididae, Phosichthyidae, Sternoptychidae and Stomiidae. Gonostomatidae (\%IRI = 26.02), Myctophidae (\%IRI = 24.77) and Sternoptychidae (\%IRI = 24.35) were important food items for C. sloani. Maurolicus muelleri (\%IRI = 36.43), Cyclothone braueri (\%IRI = 28.26) and Vinciguerria attenuata (\%IRI = 12.97) were the most important prey. Cases of cannibalism were also observed. The examination of food size spectrum, in relation to predator length, demonstrated that C. sloani developed a feeding strategy aimed to maximizing energy input and based on the capture of few and relatively large prey: more than 50\% of prey items exceeded the value of 20\% for ratio between prey and predator size (SL) and the 5.4\% of prey measured more than 50\% of predator size. Differences in food composition across seasons were found; C. braueri and M. muelleri were more abundant in autumn, V. attenuata during spring. Prey items mainly belongs to weakly vertical migrating fauna, usually concentrated at 400 m Deep Scattering Layer.},

The aim of this paper is to test the influence of lunar phases, winds and seasons upon the frequency of occurrence of strandings of mesopelagic fish. Species abundance in relation to these factors was quantified for the first time. Specimens were collected stranded on the shore along the Sicilian coast of the Strait of Messina between 2008 and 2016. Overall 32 species belonging to seven families (Gonostomatidae, Microstomatidae, Myctophidae, Paralepididae, Phosichthyidae, Sternoptychidae, Stomiidae) were found stranded. Myctophidae was the family including the highest number of species (16), whereas Gonostomatidae was the most abundant in terms of total number of individuals (47.2\%), mainly thanks to the species Cyclothone braueri. The moon, which influences the strength of currents (highest during full and new moon phases) and irradiance (higher in some lunar phases, such as the full moon), affected the abundance of stranded mesopelagic fish in the study area. The highest number of stranding events was recorded during the new moon: 34.6\% of the total relative abundance of stranded mesopelagic fish. Wind blowing from the sea towards the coastline (southeasterly and easterly winds) created the best conditions for strandings. The highest abundance of stranded specimens was recorded during the winter season.},

However, the relationship between these structures and intermediate trophic levels is much more obscure. In this paper we address this knowledge gap by comparing acoustic measurements of mesopelagic fish concentrations to satellite-derived fine-scale Lagrangian Coherent Structures in the open ocean. The results demonstrate unambiguously that higher fish concentrations are significantly associated with stronger Lagrangian Coherent Structures, and we observe that these features represent a limiting condition for high fish concentrations. A model, specifically built for mid trophic levels with realistic parameters, provides a possible mechanism of fish aggregation, and is coherent with the observations. These results may help to integrate intermediate trophic levels in trophic models, which can ultimately support management and conservation policies.},

  abstract = {Group formation in animals is a widespread phenomenon driven by food acquisition, reproduction, and defense. Life in the ocean is characteristically aggregated into horizontally extensive layers as a result of strong vertical gradients in the environment. Each day, animals in high biomass aggregations called ``deep scattering layers'' migrate vertically, comprising the largest net animal movement on earth. This movement is commonly thought of as a predator avoidance tactic, however, the aggregation of animals into layers has been viewed as an incidental outcome of similar responses by many individuals to the risk of visual predation coupled with the location of resources including food and oxygen rather than active, socially mediated congregation for defense purposes. Here, using a newly adapted autonomous vehicle to measure individual characteristics, we provide the first measures of the internal layer structure, demonstrating that these features are made up of many topologically scaled, mono-specific aggregations, or ``schools'' rather than an indiscriminate mix of sizes and species. Schools responded to predators using behavior much like flash compression while neighboring aggregations increased their spacing to maintain coherent layers. Rather than simply an incidental outcome, the formation of layers of life in the sea is a highly organized process driven, at least in part, by biotic pressures for cohesion with broad adaptive significance for the myriad species that inhabit these ubiquitous features. These observations highlight the range of spatial scales we must examine in order to understand the strong impacts these high-biomass layers have on ecological and biogeochemical processes in the sea.},

  abstract = {Each day, motile pelagic organisms of all sizes undergo vertical movements tied to sunset and sunrise. Diel migration of animals is thought to result from the competing need to feed in energy rich surface waters while avoiding visual predators. Previous study using a newly adapted autonomous vehicle to measure individual characteristics in scattering layers provided the first measures of the internal layer structure, demonstrating that deep scattering layers can be made up of many topologically scaled, mono-specific aggregations, or ``schools.'' Follow-up measurements presented here show these schools of mesopelagic animals remain coherent during upward migration at dusk. We found that groups of smaller animals began migrating sooner each night than larger individuals, consistent with their relatively lower detectability by visual predators. We also found a correlation with taxonomic differences in swimming capabilities, suggesting that the ability to avoid predators if they are encountered also plays a role in the patterns of migration observed. The presence of acoustic predators, Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), however, altered this pattern for their primary prey, causing squid to remain at depth for approximately 40 min longer than others. The risk of predation by this air-breathing predator decreases with depth, making delaying migration an appropriate response to this largely nonvisual predation risk. Understanding the timing of individual migration patterns provides insights into the bioenergetic and predator\textendash prey processes in the mesopelagic zone that are critical for understanding the ecological and biogeochemical impacts of these high biomass layers in the ocean.},

Analyses were conducted of the demersal fish on the MidAtlantic Ridge using bottom trawl data from the 2004 R.V. G.O. Sars expedition to the ridge segment north of the Azores (421N) to south of Iceland (541N). Overall fish biomass and abundance declined with depth from the summit of the ridge to the middle rises on either side. Sixty-nine species were recorded in the 17 trawls used in the analyses, but several specimens could only be determined to genus level, and the real species number is probably around 80. Multivariate analyses revealed that the species composition primarily changed with depth, and that variation by latitude was secondary. The latitudinal variation was greater in shallow than in deep areas. Cross-ridge differences were apparently minor, but pairwise comparisons of stations at the same depth and latitude on either side of the central rift valley indicated that such differences may occur. The number of species was inversely related to latitude, but declined with depth below the slope depths. Evenness was higher in deep slope and rise areas than on the slopes. Assemblages of species could be defined for different depth zones and sub-areas, but there was no clear zonation by depth. Individual depth and latitudinal ranges of the different species produced the patterns. Temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration were similar at all trawling locations, and other factors varying more strongly with depth and latitude appear to influence the distribution patterns of individual species and assemblage structure. A general decline in food availability with depth may explain the decrease in abundance and biomass with depth. A difference in pelagic productivity and species composition of zooplankton and pelagic nekton between the areas north and south of the Sub-polar Front may underlie the latitudinal change in abundance and species composition.},

  abstract = {Mesopelagic fishes of the southeastern Indian Ocean are represented by a high number of lanternfish species (Myctophidae). The horizontal distribution patterns of their larvae have been previously studied; however, research on larval feeding habits is non-existent. The goal of this study was to describe the diet and trophic-based strategies of the most abundant myctophid larvae off Western Australia through stomach content analysis. Samples were collected in autumn 2007 off southwestern Australia when this oligotrophic area was under the influence of the seasonal Leeuwin Current, and in autumn 2010 on the tropical continental shelf of northwestern Australia. The species investigated during these periods were Benthosema fibulatum, B. pterotum, B. suborbitale, Dasyscopelus asper, Diaphus ``deep'' and ``slender'' morphotypes, Hygophum hygomii, Lampadena luminosa, Lamp\- anyctus alatus, Lampanyctus spp. and Myctophum sp. Generally, myctophid larvae showed a diurnal feeding pattern. Only postflexion stages in L. alatus, L. luminosa, B. pterotum, Diaphus ``slender'', and Myctophum sp. preyed at dawn or during the night. The highest feeding incidence was found in L. luminosa and the Diaphus ``deep'' morphotype, while the lowest, in H. hygomii. Generally, larvae were zooplankton feeders with nauplii and copepodites being the most abundant dietary groups, except for B. suborbitale and Myctophum sp. where the small non-calanoid genus Oncaea was dominant. Soft organisms such as appendicularians were frequent items in most fish diets throughout their entire larval phase, and highly abundant in Diaphus ``deep'' morphotype. The wide prey-size spectrum indicates that the majority of the fish species were not size-specific feeders for most of their larval life. Nevertheless, B. suborbitale, B. fibulatum, and L. alatus preferred larger prey, ignoring the smaller items as they grew. Larval feeding patterns of similar genera from other ecosystems are discussed and compared with those in Western Australia.},

  abstract = {Myctophids, gonostomatids and sternoptychids are the most abundant teleosteans worldwide and constitute an important assemblage of the mesopelagic ecosystem, functioning as vehicles of energy and matter through trophic webs. This study concentrates on the trophic ecology of the most abundant mesopelagic fishes of the western Mediterranean (WM) based on stomach content analysis. The myctophids (in this study: Benthosema glaciale, Ceratoscopelus maderensis, Lobianchia dofleini, Myctophum punctatum, Hygophum benoiti, Hygophum hygomii, Lampanyctus crocodilus, Lampanyctus pusillus and Notoscopelus elongatus) perform extensive diel migrations across the water column, between the surface to as deep as 1000 m, interacting with plankton and micronekton at multiple depths, and generally feeding in the epipelagic layers at night. In contrast, the gonostomatids Cyclothone braueri, Cyclothone pygmaea, and the sternoptychid Argyropelecus hemigymnus remain below epipelagic layers, feeding at different times throughout the day and night. The diet composition, trophic niche breadth and prey selectivity of 11 of these fish species were determined for juvenile and adult individuals from two surveys performed in December 2009 and July 2010 in the western Mediterranean Sea. The number of prey items varied among species, e.g. Myctophum punctatum was the species with the highest feeding intensity, reaching ca. 700 prey items in a stomach, whereas the mean number of prey in Cyclothone braueri was low (usually 1 or 2 prey per stomach). A dietary shift towards larger prey was evident from juveniles to the largest and oldest adult individuals, despite trophic niche breadths did not increase with body length for any of these mesopelagic species. The diets of the small gonostomatids, sternoptychid and early juveniles of myctophids were dominated by non-calanoid copepods, ostracods, and other small zooplankton, whereas medium-sized myctophids, e.g. L. dofleini or H. benoiti, preyed mainly on calanoids. The oldest stages of L. crocodilus and N. elongatus fed mostly on macrozooplankton and micronekton. There was high diet overlap among mesopelagic fish species and strong heterogeneity in diet composition at intraspecific level. Nevertheless, some species showed certain degree of segregation of food resources, determined by the developmental stage or spatial distribution, and positive selection towards particular prey items. The Chesson's electivity index showed that L. dofleini, N. elongatus, L. crocodilus and L. pusillus preyed selectively on euphausiids; B. glaciale was selective on the calanoid genus Pleuromamma, and C. maderensis preferred to feed on larvaceans in autumn. The two congeneric species of Hygophum consumed a high number of food items, but H. hygomii showed positive selection for euphausiids, whilst H. benoiti preferred small corycaeid copepods. Overall, the main trophic difference among mesopelagic fishes in the WM was observed between the small non-migratory species that do not evidence a diel rhythm, feeding during both day- and night-time on small zooplankton, and the largest-sized myctophids, which fed on meso- and macrozooplankton and, more occasionally, on small fishes. Mediterranean midwater fishes can be characterised by the adoption of mixed feeding strategies, with varying degrees of specialisation on different prey types that allow flexibility in a changeable environment.},

  abstract = {Sediments associated with hydrothermal venting, methane seepage and large organic falls such as whale, wood and plant detritus create deep-sea networks of soft-sediment habitats fueled, at least in part, by the oxidation of reduced chemicals. Biological studies at deep-sea vents, seeps and organic falls have looked at macrofaunal taxa, but there has yet to be a systematic comparison of the community-level attributes of sediment macrobenthos in various reducing ecosystems. Here we review key similarities and differences in the sediment-dwelling assemblages of each system with the goals of (1) generating a predictive framework for the exploration and study of newly identified reducing habitats, and (2) identifying taxa and communities that overlap across ecosystems. We show that deep-sea seep, vent and organic-fall sediments are highly heterogeneous. They sustain different geochemical and microbial processes that are reflected in a complex mosaic of habitats inhabited by a mixture of specialist (heterotrophic and symbiont-associated) and background fauna. Community-level comparisons reveal that vent, seep and organic-fall macrofauna are very distinct in terms of composition at the family level, although they share many dominant taxa among these highly sulphidic habitats. Stress gradients are good predictors of macrofaunal diversity at some sites, but habitat heterogeneity and facilitation often modify community structure. The biogeochemical differences across ecosystems and within habitats result in wide differences in organic utilization (i.e., food sources) and in the prevalence of chemosynthesis-derived nutrition. In the Pacific, vents, seeps and organic-falls exhibit distinct macrofaunal assemblages at broad-scales contributing to beta diversity. This has important implications for the conservation of reducing ecosystems, which face growing threats from human activities.}

  abstract = {The trophic position (TP) of fishes determines their importance in terms of energy flows within food webs. However, accurate estimations of TP are often prevented because of the difficulties in tracing all food sources. This is particularly challenging for omnivorous fishes, such as those from the Order Stomiiformes. In this study, we applied recent developments in stable isotope analysis of amino acids to untangle the contributions of microbial vs. metazoan food webs in  species of Stomiiformes. The inclusion of the microbial food web reduced the differences between TP estimates using stable isotopes and those derived from stomach content analysis. In addition, the new estimates allowed to quantify the relative contribution of the microbial food web to each species (\textendash \%), highlighting the importance of detritus consumption even in piscivorous species (e.g. Stomias boa and Chauliodus danae). The comparison of TP estimates obtained with selected amino acids in fish muscle allowed for the detection of the microbial influence integrated at time scales relevant for net fish growth, even when trophic exchanges in the microbial food web occur at much shorter time scales. The assessment of TP considering the differential contribution of microbial and metazoan food webs challenges our current understanding of marine food webs; yet provides a new quantitative tool for the analysis of their structure and function.},

  abstract = {The structure and variability of pelagic food webs along the north and northwestern shelf of the Iberian Peninsula were analysed using natural abundance of nitrogen stable isotopes of plankton and pelagic consumers. Plankton composition was mainly studied in size-fractionated samples, but also the isotopic signatures of three copepod species, as representative of primary consumers, were considered. Several fish species were included as planktivorous consumers, with special attention to sardine (Sardina pilchardus). Finally, top pelagic consumers were represented by the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). The relationship between trophic position and body size implies large variability in the ratio of predator to prey sizes, likely because widespread omnivory and plankton consumption by relatively large predators. Planktivorous species share a common trophic position, suggesting potential competition for food, and low nitrogen isotope enrichment between prey and consumers suggest nutrient limitation and recycling at the base of the food web. Both experimental and field evidences indicate that the muscle of sardine integrates fish diet over seasonal periods and reflects the composition of plankton from large shelf areas. The low mobility of sardines during periods of low population size is consistent with differential isotopic signatures found in shelf zones characterised by upwelling nutrient inputs.},

Large differences in individual size, and consequently in growth rates and the relevant spatial and temporal scales involved, make the integration of microorganisms and large metazoans in a common food web framework difficult. Using stable isotopes, this study estimated the trophic position of 13 species of micronektonic fishes to examine the microbial and metazoan contribution to mid trophic level consumers. Vertically migrant species displayed higher trophic positions than non-migrant species in all depth layers. The estimated trophic positions agreed well with those from the literature, but all species displayed mean increases between 0.5 and 0.8 trophic positions when taking into account microbial trophic steps. Trophic position, but not the relative importance of the microbial food web, increased with individual size, suggesting that current estimates of the trophic position of top consumers and of the length of oceanic food webs are too low because they are based only on metazoan trophic steps. This finding calls for a review of trophic position estimates and of the efficiency of trophic transfers along oceanic food webs.},

  abstract = {A number of scientific papers in the last few years singled out the influence of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of fish species, highlighting the need for the fisheries scientific community to investigate, besides biomass estimates, also the habitat selection of commercially important fish species. The Mediterranean Sea, although generally oligotrophic, is characterized by high habitat variability and represents an ideal study area to investigate the adaptive behavior of small pelagics under different environmental conditions. In this study the habitat selection of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and European sardine Sardina pilchardus is analyzed in two areas of the Mediterranean Sea that largely differentiate in terms of environmental regimes: the Strait of Sicily and the North Aegean Sea. A number of environmental parameters were used to investigate factors influencing anchovy and sardine habitat selection. Acoustic surveys data, collected during the summer period 2002\textendash 2010, were used for this purpose. The quotient analysis was used to identify the association between high density values and environmental variables; it was applied to the entire dataset in each area in order to identify similarities or differences in the ``mean'' spatial behavioral pattern for each species. Principal component analysis was applied to selected environmental variables in order to identify those environmental regimes which drive each of the two ecosystems. The analysis revealed the effect of food availability along with bottom depth selection on the spatial distribution of both species. Furthermore PCA results highlighted that observed selectivity for shallower waters is mainly associated to specific environmental processes that locally increase productivity. The common trends in habitat selection of the two species, as observed in the two regions although they present marked differences in hydrodynamics, seem to be driven by the oligotrophic character of the study areas, highlighting the role of areas where the local environmental regimes meet `the ocean triad hypothesis'.},

  abstract = {Vertical migrations into shallower waters at night are beneficial for migrators as they reduce predation risk and allow migrators to encounter a higher density of prey. Nevertheless, ocean acoustics data and trawl data have shown that a portion of some vertically migrating populations remain at depth and do not migrate. One hypothesis for this phenomenon is the Hunger-Satiation hypothesis, which in part states that the non-migrating portion of the migrating species-assemblage refrains from migrating if they have full or partially full stomachs from daytime or nocturnal feeding. However, stomach fullness of the non-migrating subpopulation compared to the migrating portion has rarely been studied, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient samples. The stomach fullness levels of numerically abundant crustacean and fish species with wellknown depth distributions were quantified in the present study. Animals were captured during night trawls from discrete-depth intervals between 0 and 1,500 m. Stomach fullness indices were assigned from 0 to 5 and compared between migratory taxa caught in shallow and deep waters. Data from the crustaceans Acanthephyra purpurea, Gardinerosergia splendens, Plesionika richardi, and Systellaspsis debilis, as well as the fishes Lampanyctus alatus, Lepidophanes guentheri, and Notolychnus valdiviae, provided support for the Hunger-Satiation hypothesis, while data from the crustaceans Gennadas capensis and Gennadas valens and the fish Benthosema suborbitale did not. These findings suggest that stomach vacancy may be just one of several factors regulating the dynamics of vertical migration in those species whose behavioral plasticity suggests daily ``choices'' in whether or not to vertically migrate.},

Developing ways to test among these hypotheses will, however, require new ways to quantify animal behavior and biophysical oceanographic processes at coherent spatiotemporal scales.

Growing pressure for ocean twilight zone fisheries creates an urgent need to understand the importance of the deep pelagic ocean to large marine predators.},

  abstract = {Recently revisited, the concept of niche ecology has lead to the formalisation of functional and trophic niches using stable isotope ratios. Isotopic diversity indices (IDI) derived from a set of measures assessing the dispersion/distribution of points in the d-space were recently suggested and increasingly used in the literature. However, three main critics emerge from the use of these IDI: 1) they fail to account for the isotopic sources overlap, 2) some indices are highly sensitive to the number of species and/or the presence of rare species, and 3) the lack of standardization prevents any spatial and temporal comparisons. Using simulations we investigated the ability of six commonly used IDI to discriminate among different trophic food web structures, with a focus on the first two critics. We tested the sensitivity of the IDI to five food web structures along a gradient of sources overlap, varying from two distinct food chains with differentiated sources to two superimposed food chains sharing two sources. For each of the food web structure we varied the number of species (from 10 to 100 species) and the type of species feeding behaviour (i.e. random or selective feeding). Values of IDI were generally larger in food webs with distinct basal sources and tended to decrease as the superimposition of the food chains increased. This was more pronounced when species displayed food preferences in comparison to food webs where species fed randomly on any prey. The number of species composing the food web also had strong effects on the metrics, including those that were supposedly less sensitive to small sample size. In all cases, computing IDI on food webs with low numbers of species always increases the uncertainty of the metrics. A threshold of ,20 species was detected above which several metrics can be safely used.},

  abstract = {A mid-water trawl survey conducted between depths of 1000 and 3000 m in the eastern Gulf of Mexico found 54\% of the organisms collected were gonostomatid fishes. Lophogastrids within the family Eucopiidae were also common (17.3\%), as were decapod shrimps within the families Oplophoridae and Benthesicymidae (9.9 and 7.1\% respectively). We examined the gut contents of 14 prominent species from this assemblage to determine if available food resources were partitioned. Cluster analysis of stomach contents resulted in 4 clusters based on taxonomic composition and 3 based on prey size. Bristlemouth fishes (Gonostomatidae) of the genus Cyclothone and lophogastrids of the genus Eucopia were planktivorous, consuming smaller prey items such as copepods and ostracods. Decapods within the family Oplophoridae tended to be piscivorous and consumed relatively large prey. Dendrobranchiate shrimps appeared to regularly consume detrital material, although the contribution of such material to the overall diet could not be quantified. The hatchetfish Sternoptyx pseudobscura had a large proportion of shallow-living taxa in its diet despite being non-migratory. Many of the bathypelagic species were found to be more piscivorous than mesopelagic counterparts within the same family or genus. Dietary overlap in both prey size and taxonomic composition was rare, occurring only 16.5\% of the time. The most prevalent pattern (\textasciitilde 50\% of species pairings) was overlap in neither diet category, suggesting the species partitioned food resources.},

School-detection algorithms are commonly used to describe and analyse spatial distributions of pelagic and semi-pelagic organisms observed in echograms. This approach is appropriate for species that form well-defined schools, but is limited when used for species that form demersal layers or diffuse pelagic shoals. As an alternative to metrics obtained from school-detection algorithms, we used landscape indices to quantify and characterize spatial heterogeneity in density distributions of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). Survey transects were divided into segments of equal length and echo integrated at a resolution of 20 m (horizontal) and 1 m (vertical). A series of 20 landscape metrics was calculated in each segment to measure occupancy, patchiness, size distribution of patches, distances among patches, acoustic density, and vertical location and dispersion. Factor analysis indicated that the metric set could be reduced to four factors: spatial occupancy, aggregation, packing density, and vertical distribution. Cluster analysis was used to develop a 12-category classification typology for distribution patterns. Visual inspection revealed that spatial patterns of segments assigned to each type were consistent, but that there was considerable overlap among types.},

We present data on the abundances, horizontal and vertical distributions, and diet of these "shes. We also discuss brie\#y the importance of the oxygen minimum zone and predation on myctophid "shes to the ecology of these mesopelagic predators. Chauliodus pammelas and C. sloani appear to have only partially overlapping horizontal distributions in the Arabian Sea, with C. pammelas more common to the north and C. sloani more common to the south. Our data support previous results suggesting that diel vertical migration is the norm for these species, with smaller individuals usually nearer to the surface and larger individuals tending to stay deeper. In contrast to Chauliodus, Stomias aznis and S. nebulosus appear to have largely overlapping horizontal distributions in the Arabian Sea. However, they may have slightly di!erent vertical distributions, with S. aznis living slightly shallower (especially at night) than S. nebulosus. All four species spend most of their time in the oxygen minimum zone, entering the surface oxygenated waters (100\vphantom\{\}150 m) only at night (if at all). The diets of C. pammelas, C. sloani, and S. aznis consisted mainly of lantern"shes, Myctophidae, and other "shes. In contrast, S. nebulosus, the smaller of the two Stomias species, ate mostly copepods and other crustaceans. This di!erential feeding may allow the two Stomias species to co-occur. Three of these four stomiids appear to play an important role in predation on myctophid "sh populations in the Arabian Sea. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Lampanyctus regalis had a lower specific gravity (1.040) due to high water content of the tissue.The swimbladder to body volumes in S. leucopsarus and D. theta were inversely related to body size and lipid content, indicating that lipids assume the primary buoyancy function as the gas-filled swimbladder regresses with age. This change may eliminate the physiological constraints imposed by a gas-filled swimbladder and permit the more extensive diel vertical migrations of adults.},

Here we synthesize the current state of knowledge of research on age, growth, and reproduction of mesopelagic fishes, the basic biological information fundamental to understanding the population dynamics of species in this ecosystem. Collectively, two-thirds of life history research on mesopelagic fishes has been undertaken on myctophids, yet many other abundant and important groups are lacking research. There are generally hotspots of mesopelagic fish research mostly centred in the northern hemisphere, with little to no coverage in the Indo-Pacific region nor the poles. Furthermore, the effects of some anthropogenic stressors\textemdash chiefly climate change and resource extraction\textemdash on the life history of the animals in this zone is uncertain and needs to be considered. Knowledge of growth and reproduction are key traits required for a holistic assessment and understanding of this ecosystem, and hopefully this synthesis will provide a springboard for greater focus in this area.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive trophic studies in the vast mid-oceanic regions are rare compared to coastal and fisheries-oriented investigations. Field sampling conducted by the multidisciplinary, international Census of Marine Life project MAR-ECO, namely the 2004 G.O. Sars cruise, has generated one of the largest open ocean deep-pelagic sample collections ever obtained. With the overall goal of understanding carbon flow processes within and through the deep-pelagic nekton associated with the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge system (N MAR), quantitative trophic analyses were conducted in order to identify the major intraspecific patterns in diet of characteristic members of the midwater fish community. Diets of five abundant species of zooplanktivorous fishes were examined in detail in terms of prey taxonomy and variability in space, ontogeny and diel cycle. Two major patterns of feeding were identified. Pattern 1 included three species preying primarily on copepods, Argyropelecus hemigymnus, Maurolicus muelleri and Vinciguerria attenuata, the former two of which revealed spatial differences in diet with latitude, mostly likely related to latitudinal prey distributions and densities. Maurolicus demonstrated ecological differences in diet that mirrored phenotypic variation North and South of the Subpolar Front, an ``oceanic species concept'' question that warrants further research. Pattern 2 included two species feeding primarily on amphipods, Argyropelecus aculeatus and Sternoptyx diaphana, both of which showed ontogenetic variability in feeding primarily related to specific amphipod taxon sizes, rather than prey switching to other major prey taxa. This is the first study that highlights the importance of amphipods in the diets of these species. All fish species showed selectivity in prey choice, possibly related to competition with the other major nekton components along the N MAR, namely the Myctophidae and other zooplanktivorous Stomiiformes. Daily ration fell within the expected values for midwater fishes (1\textendash 4\% of body weight) with the exception of S. diaphana, suggesting that this species is unique among the zooplanktivores \textendash{} either its ration is three times higher than the other species, or it eats one-third as often (i.e., every 3 days). Given the high percent stomach fullness observed throughout the diel cycle, we believe the former to be the case, which is the first estimate of its kind for a midwater fish. In order to facilitate further quantitative research on mesopelagic carbon cycling, detailed prey length/weight regressions are presented here.},

Overall, d13C values ranged from \`A25.3\& to \`A18.2\&, thus allowing characterizing of the fish habitats, with inshore/benthic species having more positive d13C signatures than offshore/pelagic ones. No clear difference in the d13C values of pelagic fishes was found between species living in neritic and oceanic waters. Overall, the d15N signatures of neritic pelagic and epibenthic fishes encompassed w1.0 trophic level (3.1\&), a higher difference than that (1.4\&) found within the oceanic assemblage. Fishes with the lowest and highest d15N values are primarily invertebrate- and fish-eaters, respectively. The isotopic niches of fishes illustrate the different mechanisms allowing coexistence, with most fishes segregating at least by one of the two niche axes (d13C and d15N). Muscle isotopic values also document interindividual foraging specialization over the long-term in coastal benthic fishes, but not in more offshore pelagic species. Finally, the d15N signatures of fishes overlap with those of penguins and seals, indicating that seabirds and marine mammals share the upper levels of the Antarctic pelagic ecosystem with some large fish species.

Most of the species show distinct isotopic niches that differ by at least one of the two niche axes (d13C habitat and d15N trophic position), indicating trophic partitioning within the assemblage. Strong niche segregation occurs within each of the three most common genera of myctophids (Electrona, Gymnoscopelus, and Protomyctophum), illustrating the different mechanisms (habitat and dietary segregation) that allow coexistence of closely related species. Calculated trophic levels (TLs) of myctophids ranged from 3.3 to 4.2, showing that they are secondary and tertiary consumers in the pelagic ecosystem. The positive relationship between TL and standard length of fish points out a structuring effect of size, with larger species (Gymnoscopelus spp.) occupying a higher trophic position than smaller species (Krefftichthys anderssoni and Protomyctophum spp.). Myctophids occupy an intermediate trophic position between macrozooplanktonic crustaceans and seabirds and marine mammals within the pelagic ecosystem. However, the TLs of large myctophids overlap those of crustacean-eating seabirds [e.g., Eudyptes spp. (crested penguins) and Pachyptila belcheri ]. The isotopic niche of myctophids indicates that Aptenodytes patagonicus (king penguin) adults prey upon K. anderssoni when they feed for themselves, thus exemplifying the usefulness of isotopic datasets on potential prey of predators to depict trophic relationships.},

Organisms have, however, adapted to these conditions and high densities of animals live surrounding the venting waters. This work endeavours to describe current knowledge concerning the physiology and biochemistry of hydrothermal vent animals in the context of what it can teach us about the deep-sea and marine symbioses in general. A major theme is the physiological and biochemical attributes of the vent chemoautotrophic symbioses, and the integration of these attributes in the functioning associations. First we consider the characteristics of the vent environment in the context of the dynamic nature of the water flows which support these habitats. Subsequent sections review the major areas where information concerning the physiology and biochemistry of vent animals is available. The concluding sections draw this information together to approach a better understanding of the functioning of the chemoautotrophic symbioses which dominate these habitats.},

  abstract = {The Bay of Biscay (north-east Atlantic) is an open marine ecosystem of particular concern in current European environmental policies. Indeed, it supports both a high biological diversity and numerous anthropogenic activities such as important fisheries. For the first time, stable isotope analyses (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen and analysis of total mercury (T-Hg) concentrations in the muscle (edible flesh) were performed on adult stages of a wide range of species (i.e., 120 species) from various taxa and various habitats of this ecosystem. Concentrations of this non-essential metal, toxic to all living organisms, ranged from 39 to 5074 ng g\`A1 dry weight. Calculations of species' trophic positions (TPs) through SIA revealed a limited effect of TP in explaining Hg bioaccumulation by high trophic level consumers in particular. On the contrary, our results suggest an important role of habitat and/or feeding zone, which strongly influence muscle Hg bioaccumulation. Deep-sea fish species effectively presented the highest Hg concentrations. Possible interactions between biological factors (e.g., age of deep-sea organisms) and bioavailability of the metal in the deep-sea environment are discussed to explain such enhanced bioaccumulation of Hg by deep-sea fauna in the Bay of Biscay. This study also highlights a potential risk for human health when deep-sea fish are consumed frequently.},

Here, we report for the first time in the Bay of Biscay, North-East Atlantic, the body composition in various biological parameters and chemical elements of a meso-to bathype\- lagic micronektonic community. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N), C:N ratios, en\- ergy density, as well as the concentrations in 6 macro-minerals and 13 trace elements including essential (micronutrients) and non-essential elements (undesirables, with no know biological function) were measured in whole organisms of 4 crustacean and 11 fish species caught simultaneously around 800 m depth. The results showed a low variability of {$\delta$}13C values, confirming that all studied species share the same habitat. On the contrary, large differences were observed among species for several elements. Trace elements showed the greatest variability (i. e. larger range of values), especially silver (Ag), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt and vanadium. Significant differences were also revealed among taxa for Ag, As, Cd, copper and strontium concentrations (with crustaceans {$>$} fish), as well as for {$\delta$}15N values and phosphorus concentrations (with fish {$>$} crustaceans). Although concen\- trations varied greatly among species, they could be grouped according to their energy density and composition in 19 chemical elements, through hierarchical clustering analysis. Six functional groups of species have been thus identified, reflecting contrasted nutritional benefit and/or exposure to undesirables for predators feeding on this deep pelagic community. Finally, the concentrations measured for the potentially toxic trace elements (un\- desirables) exceeded the existing European thresholds for Cd and to a lesser extent mercury (Hg), which point out potential risks in the perspective of a future exploitation of these deep living resources by humans.},

  abstract = {Most of the recent framework directives and environmental policies argue for the development and the use of indicators \textendash{} notably trophodynamic indicators \textendash{} that should be able to follow ecosystems' evolution in space and time, particularly under anthropogenic perturbations. In the last decades, the use of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes ratios has increased exponentially, particularly in studies of marine ecosystems' trophic structure and functioning. This method is principally based on the assumption that the isotopic composition of a consumer directly reflects that of its food. Nevertheless, few studies have attempted to define the limits of this tool, before using it and drawing ecological conclusions from isotopic analysis. This study aimed to assess the importance of considering spatio-temporal variations in isotopic signatures of consumers when using d13C and especially d15N values in open ecosystems with complex food webs, using the Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic) as a case study. To this end, more than 140 species from this marine ecosystem were analysed for the isotopic signatures in their muscle tissue. They were sampled from coastal to oceanic and deep-sea areas and at different latitudes, to evaluate spatial variations of isotopic signatures. Selected species were also sampled over several years and in two seasons to account for inter-annual and seasonal variations. In the Bay of Biscay temperate ecosystem, which is subject to both coastal and oceanic influences \textendash{} two main river inputs and upwelling areas \textendash, d13C and d15N values significantly decreased from inshore to offshore species, and to a lesser extent from benthic to pelagic organisms. River discharges appeared to be the first factor influencing d13C and d15N values in consumers. From the important spatial variations detected in d15N values in particular, we suggest that in such contrasted ecosystem, nitrogen isotopic ratios may also be revisited as an indicator of the feeding area. Moreover, we demonstrate that several baselines should be used when calculating trophic levels from d15N values. From the temporal variations detected, we recommend concentrating on a short time scale for the sampling most organisms.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent European environmental policies argue for the development of indicators of the ecological status of ecosystems that are easy to implement and powerful enough to detect changes quickly. For instance, some indicators that are currently proposed for monitoring foodweb structure and functioning are based on the size of organisms, using size as a proxy for trophic level. However, these indicators do not necessarily accurately reflect the underlying trophic structure and dynamics to follow. Ecological tracers (i.e. chemical parameters measured in consumer tissues to infer the trophic ecology of organisms) may serve as complementary indicators of trophic level, and may also help distinguish different populations of a species when more commonly used methods (e.g. genetic, age determination) present their own limitations. Here, we analysed the potential of muscle {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values and of muscle mercury (Hg) concentrations to depict size-related trophic habits of different fish species. We expected that intra- and interspecific variation in these ecological tracers could be helpful in refining currently proposed indicators of marine ecosystems, and also help in discriminating management unitsfor some species. Four fish species were selected for their economical and/or ecological importance in the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic): whiting Merlangius merlangus, European hake Merluccius merluccius, Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and anglerfish Lophius piscatorius. Muscle {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values segregated the species and enabled us to discriminate species-specific feeding strategies with increasing size of individuals. Fish body size was not always linearly correlated with {$\delta$}15N or trophic level. In contrast, Hg concentrations and size-related Hg patterns were more similar from species to species. Interestingly, muscle {$\delta$}15N values together with Hg concentrations segregated the two putative stocks of European hake within the Bay of Biscay. Hence, we propose the combined use of ecological tracers as a promising method for accurately assigning a consumer to a trophic guild, investigating Hg trophodynamics in foodwebs, and helping discriminate distinct ecological populations within a species when defining management units.},

Empirical feeding datasets have traditionally been painstakingly generated from stomach content analysis, direct observations and from biochemical trophic markers (stable isotopes, fatty acids, molecular tools). Each approach carries inherent biases and limitations, as well as advantages. Here, using 27 years (1991\textendash 2016) of               in situ               feeding observations collected by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), we quantitatively characterize the deep pelagic food web of central California within the California Current, complementing existing studies of diet and trophic interactions with a unique perspective. Seven hundred and forty-three independent feeding events were observed with ROVs from near-surface waters down to depths approaching 4000 m, involving an assemblage of 84 different predators and 82 different prey types, for a total of 242 unique feeding relationships. The greatest diversity of prey was consumed by narcomedusae, followed by physonect siphonophores, ctenophores and cephalopods. We highlight key interactions within the poorly understood `jelly web', showing the importance of medusae, ctenophores and siphonophores as key predators, whose ecological significance is comparable to large fish and squid species within the central California deep pelagic food web. Gelatinous predators are often thought to comprise relatively inefficient trophic pathways within marine communities, but we build upon previous findings to document their substantial and integral roles in deep pelagic food webs.},

Recent analysis of fishery data has shown that many of these species have been undergoing decadal increases in abundance, suggesting system-wide changes. A. ferox diet was numerically dominated by hyperiid amphipods from 3 genera (Phrosina, Phronima, Platyscelus; 37\%N), pelagic polychaete worms, mesopelagic fishes (including young A. ferox size classes), and cephalopods. G. serpens fed primarily on epipelagic fishes (exocoetids, molids) and ommastrephid squids. Diets of the 2 Lampris species were the most similar to one another, consisting of large numbers and frequent occurrences of the onychoteuthid squid Walvisteuthis youngorum and a diverse assemblage of epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes. More than 90\% of the L. flavobruneum stomachs were without food items; small numbers of prey identified included the ommastrephid squid Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis, aristeid shrimps, and unidentified fishes. The diet descriptions support the idea that these predatory fishes carve out unique ecological niches in the pelagic environment by exploiting unique components of micronekton communities across epipelagic and mesopelagic depth zones. Adult size classes of tunas and billfishes occupying a shared vertical habitat do not appear to compete for prey resources to any great extent, perhaps allowing for successful partitioning of limited prey resources within an oligotrophic gyre ecosystem.},

Specifically, results from the most recent diet studies were used to expand the representation of the lesser-known non-target fish species (e.g. lancetfish, opah, snake mackerel) and 9 mid-trophic micronekton functional groups. The model framework Ecopath with Ecosim was used to construct an ecosystem energy budget and to examine how changes in the various micronekton groups impact apex predator biomass. Model results indicate that while micronekton fishes represented approximately 54\% of micronekton biomass, they accounted for only 28\% of the micronekton production. By contrast, crustaceans represented 24\% of the biomass and accounted for 44\% of production. Simulated ecosystem changes resulting from changes to micronekton groups demonstrated that crustaceans and mollusks are the most important direct trophic pathways to the top of the food web. Other groups appear to comprise relatively inefficient pathways or `trophic dead-ends' that are loosely coupled to the top of the food web (e.g. gelatinous animals), such that biomass declines in these functional groups resulted in increased biomass at the highest trophic levels by increasing energy flow through more efficient pathways. Overall, simulated declines in the micronekton groups resulted in small changes in biomass at the very top of the food web, suggesting that this ecosystem is relatively ecologically resilient with diverse food web pathways. However, further understanding of how sensitive micronekton are to changes in ocean chemistry and temperature resulting from climate change is needed to fully evaluate and predict potential ecosystem changes.},

We found that trophic positions estimated from the d15N values of individual amino acids are nearly uniform within both families of these fishes across five global regions despite great variability in bulk tissue d15N values. Regional differences in the d15N values of phenylalanine confirmed that bulk tissue d15N values reflect region-specific water mass biogeochemistry controlling d15N values at the base of the food web. Trophic positions calculated from amino acid isotopic analyses (AA-TP) for lanternfishes (family Myctophidae) (AA-TP ,2.9) largely align with expectations from stomach content studies (TP ,3.2), while AA-TPs for dragonfishes (family Stomiidae) (AA-TP ,3.2) were lower than TPs derived from stomach content studies (TP,4.1). We demonstrate that amino acid nitrogen isotope analysis can overcome shortcomings of bulk tissue isotope analysis across biogeochemically distinct systems to provide globally comparative information regarding marine food web structure.},

Inter- and intra-specific variations in mercury levels of predatory pelagic fish have been previously linked to size, age, trophic position, physical and chemical environmental parameters, and location of capture; however, considerable variation remains unexplained. In this paper, we focus on differences in ecology, depth of occurrence, and total mercury levels in 9 species of commercially important pelagic fish (               Thunnus obesus               ,               T. albacares               ,               Katsuwonus pelamis               ,               Xiphias gladius               ,               Lampris guttatus               ,               Coryphaena hippurus               ,               Taractichthys steindachneri               ,               Tetrapturus audax               , and               Lepidocybium flavobrunneum               ) and in numerous representatives (fishes, squids, and crustaceans) of their lower trophic level prey sampled from the central North Pacific Ocean. Results indicate that total mercury levels of predatory pelagic fishes and their prey increase with median depth of occurrence in the water column and mimic concentrations of dissolved organic mercury in seawater. Stomach content analysis results from this study and others indicate a greater occurrence of higher-mercury containing deeper-water prey organisms in the diets of the deeper-ranging predators,               X. gladius               ,               T. obesus               , and               L. guttatus               . While present in trace amounts, dissolved organic mercury increases with depth in the water column suggesting that the mesopelagic habitat is a major entry point for mercury into marine food webs.

Similarly, 13 species of small micronekton fishes encompassed a range of 1.2 TP (TPTr-Src 2.6-3.8). The d15N values of three source AAs were found to increase with increasing depth of capture across the 13 micronekton fish species (d15NPhe range 5 6.6\&; d15NGly range 5 13.4\&; d15NSer range 5 13.6\&), indicating that some species from epipelagic, mesopelagic, and upper bathypelagic communities access distinct food resources, such as suspended particles. These isotopic depth trends are consistent with previous observations in particulate organic matter and zooplankton from the NPSG, providing new evidence that large pelagic and micronekton fishes access a food web fueled by particles formed in surface waters but that are highly modified by microbes as they slowly settle to remote depths. On the contrary, no significant relationships between the d15N values of source AAs and habitat depth were observed in the large predator fish group, of which many species move and forage across large depth gradients.},

  abstract = {Nocturnal migration of mesopelagic fish into surface waters is well-documented. Yet, although there is increasing evidence of individual-based deviations from average population migrations and of the importance of small-scale individual behavior for predator-prey interactions and energetic cycling, little is known about what mesopelagic animals do when in upper waters. Using high-resolution data from an upwardfacing, moored, split-beam echosounder we analyzed the night-time individual vertical swimming behavior of pearlsides (Maurolicus muelleri) over one winter. The population behavior is characterized by migration to the surface after sunset, ``midnight-sinking'' and another migration to the surface in the morning, followed by return to the daytime habitat. Focusing on individuals unveiled diverse behavioral patterns during different phases of the migration. After ascending to upper layers at dusk, M. muelleri leaves the surface waters, not by sinking, but by actively swimming in a step-wise pattern characterized by relocations alternated by pauses. Following the descent, vertical swimming is sustained at lower levels. Around midnight, the vertical swimming direction changes from predominantly downward to upward. Several hours before dawn, the fish start ascending toward the surface in a step-wise pattern. During population ascent in the afternoon and descent in the morning, some individuals at the fringes of schools migrate without intermittent pauses. This study documents the feasibility of using submerged, stationary echosounders in unveiling the individual behavior of mesopelagic fish.},

  abstract = {Mesopelagic fish form an important link between zooplankton and higher trophic levels in Southern Ocean food webs, however their diets are poorly known. Most of the dietary information available comes from morphological analysis of stomach contents and to a lesser extent fatty acid and stable isotopes. DNA sequencing could substantially improve our knowledge of mesopelagic fish diets, but has not previously been applied. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) of the 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) to characterise stomach contents of four myctophid and one bathylagid species collected at the southern extension of the Kerguelen Plateau (southern Kerguelen Axis), one of the most productive regions in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Diets of the four myctophid species were dominated by amphipods, euphausiids and copepods, whereas radiolarians and siphonophores contributed a much greater proportion of HTS reads for Bathylagus sp. Analysis of mitochondrial COI showed that all species preyed on Thysanoessa macrura, but Euphausia superba was only detected in the stomach contents of myctophids. Size-based shifts in diet were apparent, with larger individuals of both bathylagid and myctophid species more likely to consume euphausiids, but we found little evidence for regional differences in diet composition for each species over the survey area. The presence of DNA from coelenterates and other gelatinous prey in the stomach contents of all five species suggests the importance of these taxa in the diet of Southern Ocean mesopelagics has been underestimated to date. Our study demonstrates the use of DNA-based diet assessment to determine the role of mesopelagic fish and their trophic position in the Southern Ocean and inform the development of ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {The deep sea is the world's largest ecosystem [1], with high levels of biodiversity [2, 3] and many species that exhibit life-history characteristics that make them vulnerable to high levels of exploitation [4]. Many fisheries in the deep sea have a track record of being unsustainable [5, 6]. In the northeast Atlantic, there has been a decline in the abundance of commercial fish species since deep-sea fishing commenced in the 1970s [7, 8]. Current management is by effort restrictions and total allowable catch (TAC), but there remain problems with compliance [9] and high levels of bycatch of vulnerable species such as sharks [10]. The European Union is currently considering new legislation to manage deep-sea fisheries, including the introduction of a depth limit to bottom trawling. However, there is little evidence to suggest an appropriate depth limit. Here we use survey data to show that biodiversity of the demersal fish community, the ratio of discarded to commercial biomass, and the ratio of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) to commercial biomass significantly increases between 600 and 800 m depth while commercial value decreases. These results suggest that limiting bottom trawling to a maximum depth of 600 m could be an effective management strategy that would fit the needs of European legislations such as the Common Fisheries Policy (EC no. 1380/2013) [11] and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) [12].},

A large number of specimens of different vent species from different MAR vent fields were analysed, providing a general picture of the community structure. The isotopic composition at each vent field presents the same general trend. There is an obvious dichotomy of the trophic structure, with the mussels being significantly depleted in (13) C and shrimps being significantly enriched in C-13. MAR and Pacific vent fields present the same picture, despite a different species composition. Primary consumers are divided into main groups according to their delta(13)C signature: {$>$} - 15 (shrimps) and {$<$} - 20parts per thousand (mussels). Vent predators are tightly linked to one or the other group, but a mixed diet cannot be excluded. Bathyal species are top predators, making incursions into the vent fields to profit from the large biomass. Taking into account the above associations, a descriptive trophic model was elaborated. At the base of the food chain the chemolithotrophic bacteria predominate. Four trophic levels were then distinguished: primary consumers, feeding only on bacteria; mixotrophs feeding on bacteria and small invertebrates; vent predators feeding only on small invertebrates; and finally top predators that are mainly constituted by deep-sea fauna.},

Here, we investigate contrasting relationships between size (body mass) and depth in the scavenging and predatory demersal ichthyofauna (800\textendash 4800{$\mkern1mu$}m) of the North-east Atlantic. The mean size of scavenging fish, identified as those regularly attracted to baited cameras, increased significantly with depth, while in non-scavengers there was a significant decline in size. The increase in scavenger size is a consequence of both intra and inter-specific effects. The observation of opposing relationships, in different functional groups, across the same environmental gradient indicates ecological rather than physiological causes. Simple energetic models indicate that the dissimilarity can be explained by different patterns of food distribution. While food availability declines with depth for both groups, the food is likely to be in large, randomly distributed packages for scavengers and as smaller but more evenly distributed items for predators. Larger size in scavengers permits higher swimming speeds, greater endurance as a consequence of larger energy reserves and lower mass specific metabolic rate, factors that are critical to survival on sporadic food items.},

The larvae and transforming stages of the sternoptychids fed both during the day and at night. However, larvae of the other species fed during the day, as they apparently rely on light for prey capture. The transforming stages of myctophids showed a similar daylight feeding pattern to their larvae, but in D. vanhoeffeni both day and night feeding was evident, thereby indicating the progressive change toward the adult nocturnal feeding pattern. The number of prey and their maximum sizes were linked to predator gut morphology and gape size. Although the maximum prey size increased with predator development, postflexion larvae and transforming stages also preyed on small items, so that the trophic niche breath did not show evidence of specialization. In all the species, copepods dominated the larval diet, but the transforming stages were characterized by increasing diet diversity. Despite the poor development of these early stages, Chesson's selectivity index calculated for larvae and transforming stages showed positive selection for particular prey.},

  abstract = {Mesopelagic communities are characterized by a large biomass of diverse macrozooplankton and micronekton (MM) performing diel vertical migration (DVM) connecting the surface to the deeper ocean and contributing to biogeochemical fluxes. In the Southern Ocean, a prominent High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) and low carbon export region, the contribution of MM to the vertical carbon flux of the biological pump remains largely unknown. Furthermore, few studies have investigated MM communities and vertical flux in naturally iron fertilized areas associated with shallow bathymetry. In this study, we assessed the MM community diversity, abundance and biomass in the Kerguelen Island region, including two stations in the HNLC region upstream of the islands, and two stations in naturally iron fertilized areas, one on the Plateau, and one downstream of the Plateau. The MM community was examined using a combination of trawl sampling and acoustic measurements at 18 and 38 kHz from the surface to 800 m. A conspicuous three-layer vertical system was observed in all areas - a shallow scattering layer, SSL, between 10 and 200 m; mid-depth scattering layer, MSL, between 200 and 500 m; deep scattering layer, DSL, between 500 and 800 m - but communities differing among stations. While salps (Salpa thompsoni) dominated the biomass at the productive Kerguelen Plateau and the downstream station, they were scarce in the HNLC upstream area. In addition, crustaceans (mainly Euphausia vallentini and Themisto gaudichaudii) were particularly abundant over the Plateau, representing a large, although varying, carbon stock in the 0\textendash 500 m water layer. Mesopelagic fish were prominent below 400 m where they formed permanent or migrant layers accounting for the main source of carbon biomass. Through these spatial and temporal sources of variability, complex patterns of the MM vertical distribution and associated carbon content were identified. The total carbon flux mediated by migratory myctophids at the four stations was quantified. While this flux was likely underestimated, this study identified the main components and mechanisms of active carbon export in the region and how they are modulated by complex topography and land mass effects.},

  abstract = {Investigating the drivers of fish assemblage trophic structure is a critical question, in order to better understand ecosystem functioning, predict the effects of perturbations and implement integrated management of exploited marine ecosystems. Ecosystemic surveys enabled the determination of the trophic structure of the fish assemblages in three French marine ecosystems, namely the Eastern English Channel, the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lions, through the simultaneous collection of qualitative (stable isotopes and energy content) and quantitative (biomass) data. In the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lions, pelagic primary production supported at least 80\% of the fish biomass production, and explained the dominance of pelagic species, but with differences resulting from the different productivity. The lower productivity in the oligotrophic Gulf of Lions led to a lower total biomass, energy density as well as the predominance of zooplankton-feeders. In contrast, fluxes in the Bay of Biscay were sufficient to support a higher biomass of pelagic piscivores, and of species with higher energy content. In the shallow Eastern English Channel, the respective contributions of pelagic and benthic sources were similar. Bentho-demersal species of higher trophic level dominated this assemblage, because of their ability to exploit both pathways. Results of the present study confirmed that fisheries-focused surveys can be used as efficient platforms to address questions about ecosystem functioning. Here, it confirmed the expected differences between ecosystems and the importance of primary production and environment as drivers of fish assemblage structure and functioning. Future studies should nevertheless develop new methods to better assess the paramount role of low trophic level consumers.},

In northwestern Australia there has been little attention on the fish communities that inhabit an ancient coastline at \textasciitilde 125 m depth (the designated AC125), which is specified as a key ecological feature (KEF) of the region and is thought to comprise hard substrate and support enhanced diversity. We investigated drivers of fish species richness and assemblage composition spanning six degrees of latitude along sections of the ancient coastline, categorised as `on' and `off' the AC125 based on depth, across a range of habitats and seafloor complexity (\textasciitilde 60\textendash 180 m depth). While some surveyed sections of the AC125 had hard bottom substrate and supported enhanced fish diversity, including over half of the total species observed, species richness and abundance overall were not greater on the AC125 than immediately adjacent to the AC125. Instead, depth, seafloor complexity and habitat type explained patterns in richness and abundance, and structured fish assemblages at both local and broad spatial scales. Fewer fishes were associated with deep sites characterized by negligible complexity and soft-bottom habitats, in contrast to shallower depths that featured benthic biota and pockets of complex substrate. Drivers of abundance of common species were species-specific and primarily related to sampling Areas, depth and substrate. Fishes of the ancient coastline and adjacent habitats are representative of mesophotic fish communities of the region, included species important to fisheries and conservation, and several species were observed deeper than their currently known distribution. This study provides the first assessment of fish biodiversity associated with an ancient coastline feature, improving our understanding of the function it plays in regional spatial patterns in abundance of mesophotic fishes. Management decisions that incorporate the broader variety of depths and habitats surrounding the designated AC125 could enhance the ecological role of this KEF, contributing to effective conservation of fish biodiversity on Australia's north west shelf.},

  abstract = {The Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field, situated on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ( MAR), has been visited on a regular basis since 1992. The video imagery analyzed in this study originated from 10 cruises and was acquired either with the Nautile submersible or with the Remotely Operated Vehicle Victor 6000 between 1994 and 2008. Four faunal assemblages and two substratum types were identified on a large mussel-dominated sulfide edifice named "Eiffel Tower." Their dynamics over 14 yr were investigated both at the scale of the entire edifice, between the edifice sides, and at small patch scales, making this the first high-time-resolution long-term variations study on the MAR. Overall percentage of biological colonization and overall mussel coverage were stable on a decadal scale. However, on shorter time scales as well as on smaller spatial scales, significant differences in microbial cover and in individual assemblage coverage and distribution were observed. The small fluctuations in the rather constant overall percentage of colonization (similar to 50\%) were explained by subtle changes in hydrothermal activity, which showed a significant negative correlation. However, not all variations occurring in the community structure could be explained by the hydrothermal activity, whereas the orientation of the edifice appeared to play an important role. We proposed a succession model for the shallower MAR fields, in addition to the first quantification of the rate of change in community dynamics at this slow-spreading ridge. This rate of change appeared to be about 15\% slower than that observed on sulfide edifices from faster-spreading ridges in the Northeast Pacific.}

  abstract = {The Eiffel Tower edifice is situated in the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field at a mean depth of 1690 m on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). At this 11-m-high hydrothermal structure, different faunal assemblages, varying in visibly dominant species (mussels and shrimp), in mussel size and in density of mussel coverage, were sampled biologically and chemically. Temperature and sulphide (Sigma S) were measured on the different types of mussel-based assemblages and on a shrimp-dominated assemblage. Temperature was used as a proxy for calculating total concentrations of CH4. Based on the physico-chemical measurements, two microhabitats were identified, corresponding to (i) a more variable habitat featuring the greatest fluctuations in environmental variables and (ii) a second, more stable, habitat. The highest temperature variability and the highest maximum recorded temperatures were found in the assemblages visibly inhabited by alvinocaridid shrimp and dense mussel beds of large Bathymodiolus azoricus, whereas the less variable habitats were inhabited by smaller-sized mussels with increasing bare surface in between. Larger mussels appeared to consume more Sigma S compared with smaller-sized ({$<$} 1 cm) individuals and thus had a greater influence on the local chemistry. In addition, the mussel size was shown to be significantly positively correlated to temperature and negatively to the richness of the associated macrofauna. The presence of microbial mats was not linked to specific environmental conditions, but had a negative effect on the presence and abundance of macro-fauna, notably gastropods. Whereas some taxa or species are found in only one of the two microhabitats, others, such as polychaetes and Mirocaris shrimp, cross the different microhabitats. Temperature was proposed to be a more limiting factor in species distribution than Sigma S.},

  abstract = {Mesopelagic sound scattering layers (SSLs) are predominantly associated with mesopelagic fish taxa with gasinflated swimbladders that perform active nocturnal diel vertical migration (DVM), like species of the families Myctophidae, Gonostomatidae, Sternoptychidae and Phosichthyidae. Larger-sized species with limited, partial, asynchronous and non-migratory migration pattern (non-DVM) and without gas-bearing swimbladders are presumably invisible by hydroacoustic methods operating at lower frequencies (18\textendash 38 kHz). Their vertical migration behaviour and functional role in the mesopelagic community remain largely disregarded. The present study investigated (i) the taxonomic and functional mesopelagic fish composition (migration behaviour and feeding guild as traits) of the main SSLs and (ii) regional variation in the vertical community structure related to the presence of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the eastern tropical North Atlantic. We analysed hydro\- acoustic and biological trawl data collected concurrently with a pelagic midwater trawl in distinct SSLs between 45 and 680 m depth by means of ordination, cluster and compositional analyses. Whereas daytime hydroacoustic backscatter profiles demonstrated higher mean Sv (38 kHz) backscatter at shallower depths at low-oxygen (LO) station 309 compared to the equatorial (EQ) station 330, night-time hydroacoustic profiles at LO stations could not be directly related to OMZ conditions. Catch abundances and biomass showed no clear regional pattern between EQ and LO stations. The analysis of trawl samples emphasised the importance of non-DVM species to the composition of tropical SSLs and further indicated regional and vertical variation in the mesopelagic fish com\- munity structure. At all stations, non-DVM species made up the largest proportions of total tow community composition (abundance and biomass) in the principal and secondary mesopelagic SSL during night-time (375\textendash 680 m) and during most daytime tows (LO: 390\textendash 555 m, EQ: 325\textendash 500 m). Our analysis suggests a more pronounced gradient structure in the vertical community composition of the LO compared to the EQ. On the one hand, shallower tows at eastern LO stations 306 and 311 were clustered with comparatively deeper tows. The eastern LO stations 306\textendash 315 had the highest numbers of non-DVM species in the principal epi- and mesopelagic SSL and the largest proportions of mesopelagic predatory species in the principal mesopelagic SSL. On the other hand, only the dominant DVM-species of the LO (i.e., Nannobrachium isaacsi, Ceratoscopelus warmingii, Noto\- scopelus resplendens, Lepidophanes guentheri and Hygophum macrochir) also showed consistent presence in the principal mesopelagic SSL during night-time. Moreover, our study demonstrates the usefulness of using biomass as additional parameter, when investigating functional aspects of mesopelagic community structure.},

  abstract = {The ecology of vertically migrating mesopelagic micronekton is affected by physical properties of their envi\- ronment. Increased light attenuation in particle-rich productive waters, as well as low oxygen conditions decrease the migration amplitude. This likely has implications on the trophic organisation of micronekton communities, which are predominantly governed by niche partitioning in the vertical dimension. We investi\- gated trophic structures of pelagic communities in the eastern tropical North Atlantic by comparing micronekton species assemblages from the low-oxygen region influenced by Mauritanian upwelling between 8\dbend{} and 11\dbend{} N (LO) and the less productive and more oxygenated equatorial area between 0 and 4\dbend N (EQ). We analysed stable isotopes of carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) in body tissues of 35 species of mesopelagic fishes, four species of cephalopods, two species of cnidarians, and two species of decapods and used these values as a proxy for their trophic niche and correlated them with the traits feeding guild, migration pattern, mean depth of occurrence and body size. Our results demonstrate significant regional differences in the food web structure and vertical trophic interactions of the investigated micronekton assemblages. Diurnally migrating fishes that predominantly feed on copepods exhibited higher {$\delta$}15N values in the LO (9.6\textperthousand ) than in the EQ (8.9\textperthousand ), reflecting changes in baseline values of pelagic tunicates. Contrary, all other Feeding \textendash{} Migrator guilds show lower or similar {$\delta$}15N values in the LO compared to the EQ, indicating reduced isotopic enrichment between trophic levels (TL) in the LO compared to the EQ. Further, a generally lower {$\delta$}15N enrichment between TL3 \textendash{} TL4 compared to TL2 \textendash{} TL3 was observed (LO: TL2 \textendash{} TL3: \textasciitilde 2.2\textperthousand, TL3 \textendash{} TL4: \textasciitilde 1.2\textperthousand; EQ: TL2 \textendash{} TL3: \textasciitilde 3.5\textperthousand, TL3 \textendash{} TL4: \textasciitilde 2.2\textperthousand ). Quantitative isotopic niche metrics suggest enhanced competition in trophic niche space, whereas relative isotopic niche positions indicate an increased importance of food from lower trophic levels (non-crustacean and/or gelatinous prey re\- sources) for fishes from the LO compared to the EQ. The absence of a depth-related increase in {$\delta$}15N values of partial- and nonmigrators of the LO is contrary to results from the EQ and previously published data. Low {$\delta$}15N values in partially and nonmigrating micronektonivores of the LO in comparison with those of the EQ could be due to feeding on lower trophic prey components in the LO, as is indicated by an overlap in isotopic niche with that of partially and nonmigrating mixed crustacean feeders in the LO. Alternatively, driving mechanisms could be the consumption of prey from shallower waters, regional differences in {$\delta$}15N enrichment, species-specific ecological differences or a combination of these processes. Each of these explanations is likely tightly corre\- lated to a vertical biogeochemical structuring effect of low oxygen midwater layers fuelled by high nitrate inputs from the Mauritanian upwelling region. Our study provides crucial ecological insights for a better understanding of large-scale gradients in micronekton migration patterns.},

  abstract = {Deep-sea habitats are home for a variety of yet poorly known fish species, some of which display specialized life strategies, as is the case of Bythitidae and Zoarcidae. With the purpose of elucidating biological and ecological aspects of representatives of these families in NW Mediterranean waters, a large dataset based on 599 specimens of Cataetyx alleni, 30 C. laticeps and 284 Melanostigma atlanticum captured during the last 30 years within the framework of different research projects was used to address their geographical and bathymetric distribution, population structure, reproduction, trophic ecology, parasitism and enzymatic markers in the Balearic basin. Present outcomes revealed a patchy distribution mostly for M. atlanticum, possibly related to aggregation during reproduction and to the association with specific sediments. For the three species, higher densities occurred in the mainland vs. the insular margin, and a diminishing trend in estimated densities over the last decades was observed for C. alleni and M. atlanticum likely linked to climatic oscillations. Trophic data indicated that the two Cataetyx species inhabit the water-sediment interface and mainly feed on suprabenthic prey, while M. atlanticum inhabits the water column near the bottom preying on pelagic organisms and moving towards the seabed during reproduction. These results were supported by the parasitological assessment, which revealed that parasite communities were moderately diverse and abundant for Cataetyx spp. while being highly depauperate for M. atlanticum. Present outcomes from the Mediterranean Sea confirmed reproduction of C. alleni during autumnwinter and of M. atlanticum during autumn. Spawning of the former species may occur in winter-spring, as suggested by the finding, by the first time, of two females captured in March with fully-developed embryos inside. Levels of enzymatic markers quantified in muscle were provided for C. alleni and M. atlanticum for the first time. The special interactions found between the distribution and biology of Bythitidae and Zoarcidae and the sedimentary bottoms that they inhabit indicates that such conventional habitats are more heterogeneous than it is generally assumed and deserve higher attention for future protection.},

  abstract = {Trophic relationships in Bathymodiolus azoricus mussel bed communities on the Tour Eiffel hydrothermal edifice (Lucky Strike) were assessed using delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures from 14 hydrothermal species. The nutritional basis of B. azoricus was also investigated with delta S-34. Faunal samples and environmental data (temperature, pH, total dissolved sulfide, iron and copper concentrations) were collected from 12 different locations on the edifice. Chemical conditions varied between microhabitats, and were all correlated to temperature. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic results revealed the presence of two, apparently independent, trophic groups. The first was composed of symbiont-bearing fauna (B. azoricus and their associated polychaetes Branchipolynoe seepensis), while the second enclosed heterotrophic fauna (bacterivores, cletritivores, scavengers, predators). A majority of mussels displayed delta C-13 values ranging from -27 parts per thousand to -34 parts per thousand, supporting thiotrophy as the dominant nutritional pathway at Tour Eiffel, with methanotrophy and filter feeding emerging as secondary strategies. This result was corroborated by delta S-34 signatures. However, higher delta C-13 values in larger mussels suggested that, as they grow, B. azoricus mussels rely more heavily on their methanotrophic enclosymbionts. Significant spatial variability in isotopic signatures for single faunal species was observed at the scale of the edifice for three species (B. azoricus, B. seepensis, Amathys lutzi), and environmental conditions explained variation in isotopic signatures for one-third of the species. This confirms the hypothesis raised by several authors on the role of hydrothermal fluids on the trophic network at small spatial scales. We suggest that vent fluid characteristics, by influencing microbial production, are key factors in the variation of local carbon sources at vents.},

  abstract = {Until 1985, seven vent fields were described from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). An eighth field, Mount Saldanha (36 degrees N), discovered in 1998, showed unusual geological and biological settings. Vent sites on the MAR exhibit varied environmental conditions, resulting from depth variation of the axis and associated physical parameters, and different source rocks. These could be considered as first order (i.e. most dominant) factors affecting the composition of vent communities on the MAR, in contrast to the East Pacific Rise (EPR) where geographical isolation appears to be a major determinant of faunal differences. In this paper, the geological setting and vent fluid composition of the fields are considered together with their community composition to tentatively ascertain the order of a hierarchy between dispersal and environmental control. The deepest fields ({$>$}3000 m) are rather stable systems. The shallower fields, especially Rainbow and Menez Owen, present some evidence of instability in time and space. The variability in fluid composition is related to phase separation processes (boiling/distillation of subsurface vent fluids) and to the nature of the basement rocks. Depending on depth, phase separation produces gas-enriched and metal-depleted fluids (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike) or metal-enriched brines (Rainbow, TAG). In addition, high methane content characterises the fluids formed in ultramafic rocks (Rainbow, Logatchev) compared to basaltic rocks. The discrepancy in mineral particulate fluxes at Lucky Strike and Menez Gwen, on one hand, and TAG and Rainbow, on the other, is correlated to the predominance of the vapour or brine phase. The semi-quantitative description of the faunal composition of the different vent fields displays a continuum from Rimicaris-dominated to Bathymodiolus-dominated assemblages. Rather than geographic or bathymetric zonation, this gradation appears to be related to the metal content of the fluids. In addition, the penetration of non vent species into the vent environment increases with decreasing hydrostatic pressure and/or metal content in the fluids. Similarity analysis between vent communities shows that similarity is strongest between Menez Gwen and Lucky Strike (the shallowest fields), less significant between these sites and Rainbow, and weakest for Snake Pit, The inverse relationship between filter feeding organisms and metal concentration in vent fluids could result from a hindrance of mussel bed development by particulate or toxic metal fluxes, and has to be further investigated. Conversely, high metal and particulate content would less affect the more mobile Rimicaris populations. Considering specific similarities of endemic fauna between the four best known hydrothermal vents, the distance between vent fields appears to be a first order parameter. Nevertheless, within the proximity of the Azores Triple Junction area, and in the absence of geographical discontinuity, the similarity between fields stays rather low suggesting faunal islands that have distinct composition and habitat requirements.}

  abstract = {Near the Azores Triple Junction as the Azores Plateau is approached, the ridge axis becomes shallower; its depth decreases from ca, 2400 m in the RAINBOW vent field (36 degrees 13'N) to ca. 850 m in the MENEZ GWEN vent held (37 degrees 35'N). In this area, extensive mussel beds of the mytilid Bathymodiolus azoricus dominate the hydrothermal vent fauna, along with populations of three shrimps (Rimicaris exoculata, Mirocaris fortunata and Chorocaris chacei). The main physical and chemical characteristics of the vent habitat were studied by discrete sampling, in situ analysis and sediment trap moorings. The vent fauna is distributed along a variable band where the vent fluids and seawater mix, with R. exoculata living in the most concentrated areas and Bathymodiolus azoricus in the most diluted zones. Various non-endemic species live at the border of the vent field. The variations observed in structure and composition of the communities along the depth gradient are most likely due to changes in vent fluid toxicity (metallic and sulphide content) and suspended mineral particles, which render the fluids harsher for species living there. The main faunal differences observed between LUCKY STRIKE and MENEZ GWEN hydrothermal fields are due to an impoverishment in the hydrothermal endemic species and to the penetration of bathyal species. The comparison of the three studied vent fields suggests the existence of a succession of several biogeographic islands rather than a single province. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}

  abstract = {Two experimental longline surveys were carried out in the Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) cold-water coral province (Mediterranean Sea) during May\textendash June and September\textendash October 2010 to investigate the effect of corals on fish assemblages. Two types of ``megahabitat'' characterized by the virtual absence of fishing were explored. One was characterized by complex topography including mesohabitats with carbonate mounds and corals. The other type of megahabitat, although characterized by complex topographic features, lacks carbonate mounds and corals. The fishing vessel was equipped with a 3,000 m monofilament longline with 500 hooks and snoods of 2.5 m in length. A total of 9 hauls, using about 4,500 hooks, were carried out both in the coral megahabitat and in the non-coral megahabitat during each survey. The fish Leucoraja fullonica and Pteroplatytrygon violacea represent new records for the SML coral province. The coral by-catch was only obtained in the coral megahabitat in about 55\% of the stations investigated in both surveys. The total catches and the abundance indices of several species were comparable between the two habitat typologies. The species contributing most to the dissimilarity between the two megahabitat fish assemblages were Pagellus bogaraveo, Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus spinax and Helicolenus dactylopterus for density and P. bogaraveo, Conger conger, Polyprion americanus and G. melastomus for biomass. P. bogaraveo was exclusively collected in the coral megahabitat, whereas C. conger, H. dactylopterus and P. americanus were found with greater abundance in the coral than in the non-coral megahabitat. Differences in the sizes between the two megahabitats were detected in E. spinax, G. melastomus, C. conger and H. dactylopterus. Although these differences most probably related to the presence-absence of corals, both megahabitats investigated play the role of attraction-refuge for deep-sea fish fauna, confirming the important role of the whole SML coral province as a refuge area from fishing.},

  abstract = {Data collected during the DESEAS survey carried out in three areas of the Mediterranean Sea (Balearic Sea, western and eastern Ionian Sea) were used to describe the structure and spatial distribution of the fish assemblages at depths between 600 and 4000 m. A total of 55 species (8 chondrichthyes and 47 teleost fish) were sampled, 38 of them in the Balearic Sea, 30 in the western Ionian and 37 in the eastern Ionian. Multivariate analysis showed a clear pattern of zonation with depth and geographic area. Three main assemblages were identified across the vertical gradient investigated: on the upper slope around a depth of 600 m, on the middle slope between 800 and 1300 m, and on the lower slope below 1300 m. The geographic characterisation of the ichthyofauna structure was mainly observed on the upper and middle slope. The highest abundance and biomass values were found at depths of 1000-1200 m due to the presence of larger species with high energy requirements, such as Alepocephalus rostratus, Mora moro and Galeus melastomus. On the middle slope, significant differences in the abundance, biomass and mean fish weight were detected between the three areas. Significant differences for these parameters were also shown between the middle and lower slope assemblages. A significant decrease in species richness and diversity was shown with increasing depth, indicating an impoverishment of the megafauna with depth and a higher similarity between the Balearic Sea and the Ionian Sea with regard to the greatest depths. The dominant species on the deepest bottoms were Bathypterois mediterraneus, Chalinura mediterranea and Coryphaenoides guentheri. On the lower slope, the shark Centroscymnus coelolepis was also found to be relatively abundant off the Balearic Islands, Etmopterus spinax in the eastern Ionian Sea and the teleost fish Cataetyx laticeps throughout the three study areas. The deepest bottoms of the Mediterranean Sea shelter an ichthyofauna dominated by small-medium species living in a food scarce environment in which some large mobile fishes are widespread. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies mostly carried out in the Atlantic and western Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {Eleven mesopelagic fish species from the Weddell/Scotia Sea region of the Antarctic captured during the austral spring 1983, austral fall 1986, and austral winter 1988, were analyzed for proximate composition. Water, ash level, protein, lipid and carbohydrate were examined in relation to depth of occurrence and season. No depth-related trends were evident, primarily due to a low species diversity and minimal differences in those species' vertical distributions. The Antarctic species Electrona antarctica showed a significant increase in lipid level (\% wet wt and \% ash-free dry wt) between spring, fall and winter. The increase may signify an accumulation over the productive season, possibly as a reserve for the winter months. Lipid levels (\% wet wt and \% ash-free dry wt) were significantly lower in the Weddell Sea specimens examined in this study than in previously examined identical and congeneric species taken during the same season from a more productive near-shore Antarctic region. Comparisons with congeners and confamilials from tropical-subtropical and temperate systems revealed variable trends. The Antarctic species E. antarctica and Cyclothone microdon had lower water and protein (\% wet wt) levels than similar species from tropical-subtropical or temperate regions. Lipid levels of the two species are similar to temperate individuals, while energy levels are slightly higher. In contrast, species of the genus Bathylagus show no trends in composition as a function of latitude. Differences in productivity, water-column temperature-structure, and seasonality are important considerations when examining trends among mesopelagic species.},

Diet analysis and more recent trophic biomarker approaches, such as stable isotopes and fatty-acid profiles, have enabled the description of feeding guilds and an increased recognition of the vertical connectivity in food webs in a whole-water-column sense, including benthic-pelagic coupling. Ecosystem modeling requires data on feeding rates; the available estimates indicate that deep-sea fishes have lower per-individual feeding rates than coastal and epipelagic fishes, but the overall predation impact may be high. A limited number of studies have measured the vertical flux of carbon by mesopelagic fishes, which appears to be substantial. Anthropogenic activities are altering deep-sea ecosystems and their services, which are mediated by trophic interactions. We also summarize outstanding data gaps.},

Analysis of over 14,000 tuna stomachs, using a modified classification tree approach, revealed for the first time the global expanse of pelagic predatory fish diet and global patterns of micronekton diversity. Ommastrephid squids were consistently one of the top prey groups by weight across all tuna species and in most ocean bodies. Interspecific differences in prey were apparent, with epipelagic scombrid and mesopelagic paralepidid fishes globally important for yellowfin and bigeye tunas, respectively, while vertically-migrating euphausiid crustaceans were important for albacore tuna in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Diet diversity showed global and regional patterns among tuna species. In the central and western Pacific Ocean, characterized by low productivity, a high diversity of micronekton prey was detected while low prey diversity was evident in highly productive coastal waters where upwelling occurs. Spatial patterns of diet diversity were most variable in yellowfin and bigeye tunas while a latitudinal diversity gradient was observed with lower diversity in temperate regions for albacore tuna. Sea-surface temperature was a reasonable predictor of the diets of yellowfin and bigeye tunas, whereas chlorophyll-a was the best environmental predictor of albacore diet. These results suggest that the ongoing expansion of warmer, less productive waters in the world's oceans may alter foraging opportunities for tunas due to regional changes in prey abundances and compositions.},

  abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world; however, little is known about the community structure of mesopelagic fishes in its northern (nBUS) and southern (sBUS) subsystems. We analyzed around 1900 specimens from 13 stations in the nBUS and 11 stations in the sBUS during the austral summer and found 88 species and 24 families of mesopelagic fishes. Seven distinct assemblages characterized by water mass, oxygen concentration in the surface layer, and chlorophyll concentrations between 50 and 100 m were identified. The stations belonging to the nBUS shelf assemblage were low in oxygen concentration, had a mean abundance of 0.064 ind. 10 m-2, and were represented exclusively by Diaphus dumerilii. The sBUS shelf assemblage had a mean abundance of 15.00 ind. 10 m-2 and Maurolicus walvisensis dominated. Two sBUS offshore assemblages had a mean abundance of 1.12 and 9.48 ind. 10 m-2. The most abundant taxa within the groups were Hygophum hanseni, Cyclothone spp., and D. meadi. Three nBUS offshore clusters had an abundance of 10.21, 11.88, and 14.19 ind. 10 m-2, and D. hudsoni prevailed in 2 groups, while M. walvisensis dominated the third group. Our study provides insight into the environmental factors that drive the composition of mesopelagic fishes on the shelf and in the upper pelagic zone in these highly productive subsystems. Possible future changes in these subsystems, such as an expansion of the oxygen minimum zone, can thus be expected to affect certain mesopelagic taxa that are essential for the food web of the subsystems.},

A detailed analysis of mussels collected from four MAR vent sites (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow, and Logatchev) using comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the two mussel species share highly similar to identical symbiont phylotypes. FISH observations of symbiont distribution and relative abundances showed no obvious differences between the two host species. In contrast, distinct differences in relative symbiont abundances were observed between mussels from different sites, indicating that vent chemistry may influence the relative abundance of thiotrophs and methanotrophs in these dual symbioses.}

Les moules du genre Bathymodiolus (Bivalvia : Mytilidae) dominent de nombreux sites de fluides froids, riches en m\'ethane, sur les marges continentales et de nombreux sites hydrothermaux, riches en sulfures, au niveau des dorsales oc\'eaniques. Certaines esp\`eces sont associ\'ees \`a deux types distincts de bact\'eries : des m\'ethanotrophes et des sulfoxydantes. Ces mytilid\'es constituent donc un bon mod\`ele pour l'\'etude de la diversit\'e, du r\^ole et de l'\'ecologie des associations symbiotiques multiples. Pour cette \'etude, plusieurs esp\`eces de mytilid\'es ont \'et\'e collect\'ees, \`a l'aide de submersibles, sur diff\'erents sites de fluides situ\'es \`a des profondeurs allant de 850 \`a 3300 m\`etres. Les bact\'eries associ\'ees \`a ces mytilid\'es ont \'et\'e caract\'eris\'ees par l'analyse comparative des s\'equences de leur ARNr 16S ainsi que de g\`enes fonctionnels. Une diversit\'e bact\'erienne bien plus \'elev\'ee que ce qui \'etait attendu a \'et\'e mise en \'evidence chez deux esp\`eces : quatre phylotypes bact\'eriens ont ainsi \'et\'e identifi\'es chez B. heckerae (Golfe du Mexique), et six chez Idas sp., un mytilid\'e de petite taille (M\'editerran\'ee orientale). Les m\'ethodes d'hybridation in situ de sondes fluorescentes sp\'ecifiques (FISH) et d'hybridation quantitative d'ARN sur membrane (slot blot) ont \'et\'e employ\'ees pour \'etudier l'influence de l'environnement sur les symbioses. Aucune variation d'abondance des deux phylotypes bact\'eriens associ\'es \`a Bathymodiolus sp. (Golfe de Guin\'ee) n'a \'et\'e constat\'ee, en d\'epit des concentrations de m\'ethane tr\`es diff\'erentes relev\'ees au niveau des trois agr\'egats de mytilid\'es \'echantillonn\'es. Les abondances relatives des diff\'erents phylotypes, ainsi que l'abondance bact\'erienne totale, varient en revanche entre esp\`eces et entre sites chez B. brooksii (Golfe du Mexique), B. azoricus et B. puteoserpentis (ride M\'edio-Atlantique). Pour ces deux derniers, la variation d'abondance des bact\'eries m\'ethanotrophes par rapport aux sulfoxydantes a pu \^etre reli\'ee aux caract\'eristiques des fluides hydrothermaux, notamment \`a leur concentration en m\'ethane. Le r\^ole nutritionnel des bact\'eries a \'et\'e \'etudi\'e par l'analyse isotopique de tissus et de biomarqueurs (lipides et ARNr 16S). La pr\'edominance de la m\'ethanotrophie dans la nutrition de B. brooksii, B. heckerae et B. childressii (Golfe du Mexique), chez lesquelles les bact\'eries symbiotiques m\'ethanotrophes sont majoritaires, a ainsi \'et\'e confirm\'ee. Le travail pr\'esent\'e ici montre l'int\'er\^et de combiner les approches mol\'eculaires et isotopiques avec l'\'etude \'ecologique et physico-chimique de l'environnement pour mieux comprendre les symbioses qui sont \`a la base du d\'eveloppement des communaut\'es animales caract\'eristiques des \'ecosyst\`emes associ\'es aux fluides froids et aux sources hydrothermales. Symbiotic associations between chemosynthetic bacteria and invertebrates are one of the major sources of primary production in deep-sea chemosynthesis-based ecosystems. Mussels of the genus Bathymodiolus (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) occur worldwide and can dominate the animal community at methane-rich cold seeps and sulfide-rich hydrothermal vents. Some species are associated with both sulfide-oxidizing and methanotrophic bacteria. These mussels are thus a good model for studying the diversity, role and ecology of multiple symbiotic associations, which are still poorly understood. For the present study, several species of mytilids were collected from seep and vent sites situated at depths from 850 to 3300 meters using submersibles. Symbiotic bacteria associated with these mytilids were characterized using comparative 16S rRNA and functional gene sequence analysis. In two species, the diversity of symbionts was much greater than expected, with four bacterial phylotypes in B. heckerae from the Gulf of Mexico and six phylotypes in Idas sp., a small mytilid from the eastern Mediterranean. The existence of an environmental influence on the abundance of the different bacterial phylotypes was assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative RNA hybridization. For Bathymodiolus sp. from the Gulf of Guinea, results were compared to environmental data, and no variation was seen between specimens collected on mussel beds with different methane concentrations. Relative and overall abundances of bacteria varied between species and sites in B. brooksii (Gulf of Mexico), B. azoricus and B. puteoserpentis (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). For the latter two species, the variation could be linked to characteristics of hydrothermal fluids, in particular to methane concentrations. The nutritional role of the symbiotic bacteria was investigated using stable isotope analyses, performed on whole tissues and specific biomarkers such as lipids and RNA. In B. heckerae, B. brooksii and B. childressii from the Gulf of Mexico, in which methanotrophs are the most abundant symbionts, methanotrophy was confirmed as the main source of carbon nutrition. This study emphasizes the relevance of combining molecular and stable isotope approaches with deep-sea environment investigations to understand the symbioses that fuel the metazoan communities occurring in cold seep and hydrothermal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Lanternfishes (Myctophidae) are among the most abundant, widespread, and diverse fish groups in the world ocean. They account for a significant part of oceanic fish biomass and play crucial roles in various ecosystem processes, including carbon sequestration and nutrient recycling. However, despite the increasing risks they face (e.g. global warming, plastic pollution, and exploitation of deep-sea resources), many aspects of the lanternfishes ecology still remain poorly known. Here, we investigate the species composition, vertical migration, and trophic ecology of lanternfishes in the Southwestern Tropical Atlantic (SWTA) and the influence of physicochemical factors on their horizontal structuring. We show that lanternfishes are a highly diverse and an abundant fish family of the SWTA, comprising at least 33 species and contributing 40\% of all fish collected (in number). We reveal that some of these species may differ in their patterns of prey composition and migratory behaviour, leading to multidimensional niches, underestimated trophic links (e.g. gelatinous organisms), and several mechanisms to avoid competitive exclusion. At least 73\% of the lanternfish species reported here seem to migrate to the surface to feed at night. Additionally, they are a central food source for mesopelagic and bathypelagic predators, thereby connecting shallow and deep-sea ecosystems. Finally, we show that the structure of lanternfish assemblages is not strongly affected by environmental conditions analysed here (i.e., throughout the thermohaline structure and current systems), leading to weak horizontal assemblage separation.},

  abstract = {Species of the family Sternoptychidae (hatchetfishes) occur worldwide and play critical roles by sequestering carbon, recycling nutrients, and acting as a key trophic link between epipelagic primary consumers and higher trophic levels in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, basic knowledge on their ecology is still lacking and their functional ecology remains understudied with respect to composition, organization, functions and environment interactions. Here we integrated comprehensive information collected in the western Tropical Atlantic on the diversity, abundance, distribution and trophic ecology of hatchetfishes, including physicochemical features of their habitats and extensive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data on its main prey groups. On this basis we defined five functional groups of hatchetfishes with different diet preference, isotopic composition, and vertical abundance peaks and reveal a possible high resource partitioning. Additionally, these species might have a different feeding tie chronology. Hence, hatchetfishes segregate in different ecological groups responding differently to environmental constraints including oxygen concentration and presenting diverse functional roles. As deep-sea species that migrate to epipelagic waters, hatchetfishes may play a key role in the transfer of subsurface photoassimilated carbon to deeper waters, a pathway through which the effects of climate change at the surface are transferred to the deep ocean. Moreover, as consumers of gelatinous organisms, these species convert ``gelatinous energy'' into ``fish energy'' readily usable by higher trophic levels, including endangered and commercially important species. This is a crucial trophic relationship that has been historically underestimated due to methodology limitations (e.g., quickly digested gelatinous organisms were probably underestimated in previous studies, based solely on stomach contents). Considering in ecosystem models this trophic relationship, as well as the functional organization of hatchetfishes, is important to properly answer key ecological questions including resource use, carbon transportation, and influence of mesopelagic community in climate change process.},

While these species are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities, basic biological knowledge is still lacking. For instance, major uncertainties remain on the behaviour, ecology, and thus functional roles of mesopelagic micronektivores, particularly regarding their interactions with physicochemical features. Here, we examine the trophic ecology, habitat, and migratory behaviour of the viperfish (               Chauliodus sloani               )\textemdash a poorly known and abundant deep-sea species\textemdash to further understand the ecology and thus functional role of mesopelagic micronektivores. Moreover, we explore how physical drivers may affect these features and how these relationships are likely to change over large oceanic areas. The viperfish heavily preys on epipelagic migrant species, especially myctophids, and presents spatial and trophic ontogenetic shifts. Temperature restricts its vertical distribution. Therefore, its trophodynamics, migratory behaviour, and functional roles are expected to be modulated by the latitudinal change in temperature. For instance, in most tropical regions the viperfish stay full-time feeding, excreting, and serving as prey (e.g. for bathypelagic predators) at deep layers. On the contrary, in temperate regions, the viperfish ascend to superficial waters where they trophically interact with epipelagic predators and may release carbon where its remineralization is the greatest.},

In the summer of 2000, of the 80 taxonomic forms found on the polygone, 48 were represented only by larval stages of development; 27, only by juvenile and adult specimens; and 5, by both larvae and juvenile and adult specimens. The last five species include Ceratoscopelus maderensis and Lampanyctus pusillus (Myctophidae), Arctozenus risso (Paralepididae), Stomias boa (Stomiidae), and Gonostoma elongatum (Gonostomatidae). In the summer of 2003, larval fish were absent in collections, and only juvenile and adult specimens of eight species from ten families were found.

Results: We searched and found 146 relevant publications on SEM applications in ecological studies. We found that five SEM variants had not commenly been applied in ecology, including the latent growth curve model, Bayesian SEM, partial least square SEM, hierarchical SEM, and variable/model selection. We identified ten common issues in SEM applications including strength of causal assumption, specification of feedback loops, selection of models and variables, identification of models, methods of estimation, explanation of latent variables, selection of fit indices, report of results, estimation of sample size, and the fit of model. Conclusions: In previous ecological studies, measurements of latent variables, explanations of model parameters, and reports of key statistics were commonly overlooked, while several advanced uses of SEM had been ignored overall. With the increasing availability of data, the use of SEM holds immense potential for ecologists in the future.},

Aphanopus carbo is a ben\- thopelagic species that undergoes horizontal and vertical migrations driven by spawning and by feeding, and for which a large-scale clockwise migration around the NE Atlantic is hypothesized. In this work, the adequacy of otolith microchemical composition used as tool to discriminate A. carbo specimens caught at different areas was investigated. Furthermore, potential birth areas and spatial pattern migration throughout the species life cycle were studied. Trace element concentration (TEC) in the otolith edge allowed the discrimination of the locations where specimens were caught and supported the separation between the northern and the southern distribution areas. The existence of two natal sources was suggested based on the separation of otolith core TEC into two groups. Longitudinal multivariate analyses applied to TEC data also sustained the separation of the otoliths into two main groups, but the mixing between them gives support to the species migratory hypothesis. The accep\- tance of both southern and northern spawning grounds and of migratory movements along the NE Atlantic in both northward and southward directions implies changes to the current migratory hypothesis that might be translated into new definitions of A. carbo stock structure and therefore fisheries management.},

In particular, little is known about the exchange of biomass at the interface of continental margins and deep-sea ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that the transport of organic matter from continental shelves may influence deep-sea ecosystems more than previously thought. Here, we present results of a pelagic nekton survey along the southern slope of Georges Bank, NW Atlantic, a transition area between coastal and deep-sea environments. Specimens were collected as part of the Census of Marine Life program Gulf of Maine Area project. Macrocrustacea (primarily sergestid shrimps and large euphausiids) dominated the total nekton (all taxa) numbers and biomass. Of the 85 deep-pelagic fish species collected during this cruise, the slender snipe eel Nemichthys scolopaceus (Anguilliformes: Nemichthyidae) ranked first in biomass and second in abundance. Microscopic analysis of N. scolopaceus gut contents revealed a predominance of large euphausiid and decapod prey. Other abundant potential prey, such as zooplankton, fish, and cephalopods, were absent from the diet, suggesting discriminatory feeding. Considering the relative biomass dominance of sergestid shrimps, large euphausiids, and pelagic eels in this system, the ecological interaction described here likely represents a major trophic pathway in this and similar `oceanic rim' ecosystems.},

GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},

  abstract = {A survey of the results of different ultrastructural and biochemical studies on bivalve molluscs found in dense populations on the sites of deep hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Ridge shows that these organisms demonstrate specific ecological and biological features. The most remarkable characteristic of all species is a well-developed gill, constituting the main organ in the nutritive processes, with a majority of its cells colonized by abundant chemoautotrophic bacteria. Structural modifications related to the utilization of particulate material, as well as structural adaptations attributed to bacterial colonization of the gill, are different in the Vesicomyidae Calyptogena magnifica and the Mytilidae Bathymodiolus thermophilus and Bathymodiolus sp. These differences in the degrees of adaptation indicate several possible nutritive pathways.}

Dominant species over the abyssal basin differed from those previously recorded over the neighbouring continental slope. Vertical biomass profiles indicated diffuse night-time distributions in the Central sector and extensive diel vertical migrations in the Eastern sector. In the Western sector, macrocrustacean d13C values were significantly higher, and d15N significantly lower, than those in the Eastern sector. The results indicate a cross-basin difference in the primary productivity environment and 15N enrichment at the base of the foodweb. The cross-basin pattern in lanternfish d15N values mirrored that for macrocrustaceans and was not correlated with standard length. Lanternfish d13C values did not differ between sectors, but there were depth-wise differences, with values in the shallowest stratum (0\textendash 200 m) significantly higher than those in the deepest stratum (800\textendash 1000 m). Calculated trophic levels (TLs) of lanternfishes spanned the third trophic level and marked niche segregation was evident in the Eastern (mean TL 3.0\textendash 3.9) and Central (mean TL 2.5\textendash 3.6) sectors. Together, the results suggest that the Eastern and Western sectors are distinct sub-basin scale pelagic habitats, with implications for ecosystem modelling and future monitoring.},

In PA comparisons, size-based criteria allowed for a distinction between seasonal (spring vs. summer) and environmental (oxygen minimum zone vs. tropics) factors. In HA\textendash PA comparisons, significant differences in LFDs were indicated in 20 out the 28 species\textendash region combinations, however, without association to changes in size ranges. In 8 species, younger size classes increased in dominance, whereas in 10 cases older size classes increased. In two species, a shift in modal length was observed. At community level, smaller specimens increased in relative abundance in the subtropical and tropical regions in PA samples. Slopes of normalized biomass size spectra steepened in 2015 for the tropical (\`A0.59 to \`A1.03) and subtropical region (\`A1.03 to \`A1.28) and are in line with published modelling results for unfished assemblages. The slope for the temperate region was \`A0.50 in 1966 \`A 1979. It is concluded that observed differences in length structure are owing to environmental changes.},

Spatial distribution of clusters coincided with SST and surface chlorophyll patterns. Cluster distribution further coincided with published mid-depth hydrography indicating that hydrographic recirculation features were an important determinant of community structure. Over the ridge, Melamphaidae, Serrivomeridae, Stomiidae and Centrolophidae increased in abundance. Horizontally, the myctophid Benthosema glaciale indicated the transition from temperate-subtropical to temperate-subarctic waters. The gadid Micromesistius poutassou and the alepocephalid Xenodermichthys copei were characteristic species for the shallow shelf edge assemblage. Vertically, extended depth ranges were stated for assemblages above MAR and the southern leg, as indicated for the species Gonostoma bathyphilum, and Schedophilus medusophagus. This was further tested for the saccopharyngid Saccopharynx ampullaceus. The increase of gelatinous plankton feeders over the ridge, in particular for S. medusophagus, is discussed with respect to a probable increase of gelatinous plankton abundance in the area considered. An error model was developed to address the contamination problem with respect to non-closing devices.},

  abstract = {Fatty acids are commonly used as biomarkers for making inferences about trophic relationships in aquatic and soil food webs. However, researchers are often unaware of the physiological constraints within organisms on the trophic transfer and modification of dietary biomarkers in consumers. Fatty acids are bioactive molecules, which have diverse structures and functions that both complicate and enhance their value as trophic tracers. For instance, consumers may synthesize confounding non-dietary sourced markers from precursor molecules, and environmental conditions also affect fatty acid composition. There is a vital need for more research on the uptake and transfer of trophic biomarkers in individual organisms in order to advance the field and make meaningful use of these tools at the scale of populations or ecosystems. This special issue is focused on controlled feeding experiments on a diverse taxonomic breadth of model consumers from freshwater, marine and soil ecosystems with a goal of creating a more integrated understanding of the connection between consumer physiology and trophic ecology.             This article is part of the theme issue `The next horizons for lipids as `trophic biomarkers': evidence and significance of consumer modification of dietary fatty acids'.},

Fish were collected using a macrozooplankton trawl during daylight hours at ten stations. Along the transect, 17 hydrographic stations were also performed with a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth). A total of 130 fish taxa were identified. The dominant family was Gonostomatidae, with four species (Cyclothone braueri, Cyclothone microdon, Cyclothone pseudopallida, and Cyclothone pallida) being responsible of more than 78\% of the total density. The most frequent species that appeared to be ubiquitous were C. braueri and C. pseudopallida, while Myctophidae was the most diverse family. Multivariate analyses revealed two clusters related with the latitudinal gradient. The fish community in the southern stations (25\textendash 37\textdegree N) was more diverse than in the northern stations (42\textendash 48\textdegree N). Temperature from 300 to 700\,m depth explained 65\% of variation in terms of density and 58\% in terms of biomass, both statistically significant. The investigated variation in the deep-pelagic ecosystems on a large spatial scale gives essential information to ecosystem management approaches and marine spatial planning.},

Crustaceans (particularly copepods, amphipods, and euphausiids) were the dominant prey in 18 species. Fishes were the dominant prey in five species. Further analysis showed that five of the 13 myctophid fishes had a low level of similarity in diet composition between individuals of each species, whereas the other eight species had significantly high levels of similarity. Cluster analysis and randomisation procedures suggested the existence of five trophic guilds among the Myctophidae.},

Still, with increasing accessibility and new sampling tools, quantitative data are becoming both more frequent and extensive, reducing limitations in the estimation and comparison of species diversity. Here, we review the literature for common difficulties encountered in the measurement and comparison of species diversity within and among deep-sea chemosynthetic communities. We lay out recommendations for future and ongoing work that should lead to more accurate evaluations and more robust comparisons. We advocate: (1) complete transparency in the taxonomic levels used to compute reported diversity measures and public access to data tables after publication; (2) an effort to standardize size compartments and sieves used within the research community; (3) the use of families of species diversity measures that allow for differential weighting of abundant and rare species; (4) the evaluation of the completeness of inventories and the stability of all diversity measures for all groups of samples under comparison; and (5) caution in the use and interpretation of statistical tests on species diversity. Only through appropriate tools can we hope to gain the knowledge and understanding necessary for the management and protection of the often endemic fauna found in deep-sea chemosynthetic communities.},

On the SERPENTINE cruise in March 2007 with the RN Pourquoi pas? and the ROV Victor 6000 (IFREMER), composition, abundance and distribution of dominant megafauna at Logatchev were examined and compared to published data from 1997. Our results revealed notable changes in several community characteristics. The most significant changes evident in March 2007 compared to July 1997 were the increase up to by order of magnitude in the population density of predatory gastropods Phymorchynchus spp. at the site Irina-2 and disappearance of a live population of vesicomyids at the site Anya's Garden. Other notable differences between the two periods of observation were the overall increase in the abundance in 2007 of the mussel Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis and a high abundance of gravid females of the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata at Irina-2. It is suggested that the extinction of vesicomyids occurred owing to either a sediment slide at a steep slope of the Anya's Garden locality or instability of a biotope required for vesicomyids. Live vesicomyids were not found over a large area explored at Logatchev in 2007. Other changes observed in 2007 apparently were related to seasonal fluctuations in the community at Logatchev or fluctuations in the hydrothermal activity. Any successional stages over a decadal scale at Logatchev were not observed.},

The: Logatchev; area includes three vent fields, each with a different geological setting corresponding to: (1) a large sulphide mound with 'smoking craters'; (2) an active chimney complex (known as 'Irina-2'); and (3) a diffuse flow through soft sediment ('Anya's Garden'). Hydrothermal communities found at these fields differ considerably: Anya's Garden is dominated by vesicomyid clams, Ectenagena sp. aff. kaikoi, Irina-2 by mytilid mussels, Bathymodiolus sp. aff. puteoserpentis, with swarms of shrimps and other rich associated fauna, whereas on the main mound the fauna as a whole is less abundant and less diverse. This is the first record of a living clam population on the MAR. Other bivalves found on the clam field included thyasirids, Thyasira (Parathyasira) spp., not reported previously from deep-sea hot vent communities. The biomass on the mussel bed at Irina-2 exceeds 70 kg m(-2) (wet weight with shells) and is the highest known on the MAR. The large shrimp population at Irina-2 includes swarms of Rimicaris exoculata. A diverse shrimp fauna (including a new species Alvinocaris so. aff. muricola) on the mussel bed is dominated by Mirocaris keldyshi. Overall the Logatchev area is dominated by mussels which may be attributable to the presence of both methane-oxidizing (dominant type) and sulphur-oxidizing bacterial symbionts in their gills. The diversity of vent organisms and biotopes at Logatchev appears to be the highest on the MAR.}

  abstract = {Aggregations of zooplankton, micronekton and fish are frequently observed above seamounts, canyons and shelf breaks. The aggregations are produced by five different mechanisms, all driven by ocean currents. Upwelling is frequently generated when ambient currents impinge on abrupt topographies. Nevertheless, upwelling enhances local production of zooplankton and fish only over large topographies such as shelf breaks, where the residence time of the upwelled water is sufficiently long to allow enrichment in primary production to propagate up the food web and augment the growth of resident animals. Daily accumulations occur over topographies at shallow and intermediate depths when the topography blocks the morning descent of migrating zooplankton. This mechanism is common over seamounts. Two other mechanisms are driven by behavioral response to vertical currents when zooplankton swims vertically in order to maintain depth: accumulations by depth retention against upwelling are common at depths to which migrating zooplankton descend during the day, while depth retention against downwelling seems to operate only in the upper water column (e.g., along topographically generated fronts). The fifth mechanism is driven by the amplification of currents over abrupt topographies. Strong currents enhance population growth of resident animals by augmenting fluxes of suspended food. A feed-rest hypothesis is proposed to explain how site-attached planktivorous fish can benefit from strong currents at sites with ample quiescence shelters in which the fish rest during nonfeeding intervals. Four of the above mechanisms generate ``trophic focusing'', a process by which prey from immense volumes of flowing water is accumulated (or trapped) in a relatively small confined area. The ensuing subsidy of prey propagates up the food web, supporting aggregations of higher predators, such as fish, marine mammals and fishermen. Abrupt topographies can have an important role in determining trophic interactions in the marine realm.},

  abstract = {With advances in undersea technology, image analysis has become an invaluable tool to study and monitor deep-sea ecosystems. In the Lucky Strike vent field (Mid-Atlantic Ridge), the analysis of high resolution images of different sides of the Eiffel Tower (ET) sulfide edifice has allowed the characterization of the distribution of faunal assemblages and community succession on the edifice. However, these studies were based on 2-dimentional representations (images) of a 3-dimentional structure and, thus, did not capture the effect of the structural complexity of the edifice on fauna distribution. Here we used 3D photogrammetry from ROV-based video to create 3D georeferenced models of the entire ET edifice in 2015 and 2016. We combined the analysis of the 3D reconstructions with in situ environmental measurements in order to (1) characterize the distribution of mega fauna and how it is affected by abiotic factors such as hydrothermal activity, temperature, water chemistry, currents and micro topography, (2) Assess fine-scale changes in fauna distribution between 2015 and 2016, and (3) compare measurement accuracies between 3D and 2D. Although data analysis is still ongoing, we expect that this study will allow us to refine the definition of microhabitats on ET by including additional abiotic factors (e.g. micro topography, currents), and to better grasp the influence of natural changes in the environment on community dynamics. With the imminent start of deep-sea mining activities, collecting baseline ecological data on hydrothermal vents is paramount to assess the resilience of these chemosynthetic ecosystems to potential impacts and appropriately inform conservation decisions.}

Suspended particles (defined as 0.7\textendash 53 lm) have been suggested as one of these sources but few studies have evaluated their contribution to the mesopelagic food web. We use amino acid compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis to investigate whether suspended particles are an important nutritional source to fish, cephalopod, and crustacean micronekton species in the central North Pacific. Our results suggest that micronekton feed from food webs fueled by a variety of nutritional sources including surface dwelling phytoplankton and bacteria, sinking particles, and suspended particles, with micronekton becoming more reliant on suspended particles with increasing habitat depth. Several species were identified as feeding from a primarily suspended particle-based food web including the fishes Cyema atrum, Cyclothone pallida, Melanocetus johnsonii, Serrivomer sector, and the pelagic octopod Japetella diaphana. We also found that micronekton species feeding from a suspended particle food web cannot be identified using bulk tissue d15N values. Our data support the notion that suspended particles are an important nutritional source in the lower mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic and they should be accounted for when estimating carbon supply for these communities.},

We collected 8 aggregations of R. pachyptila and the associated epifaunal community at 2 discrete sites of diffuse hydrothermal activity, in December 2001 and December 2002. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of the biotic and abiotic factors related to hydrothermal vent activity, significant differences in the structure and the composition of the community were expected to occur at the scale of either 1 yr or 500 m distance between very different sites. There was no significant difference in the temperature ranges of the diffuse flow between sites or years, even though the environmental conditions were very different at the 2 sites. At 1 site (Riftia Field), the diffuse hydrothermal fluids had relatively low concentrations of sulfide, low pH, and high concentrations of iron. At the other site (Tica), the diffuse hydrothermal fluids had higher sulfide concentrations, the pH was closer to neutral, and iron was undetectable. The physiological condition of R. pachyptila appeared to reflect the availability of sulfide at each site. However, the structure and the composition of the epifaunal community were remarkably similar between sites and years, with the exception of a few species. Aggregations of R. pachyptila support high local species diversity relative to the surrounding seafloor and high community similarity in different hydrothermal vent habitats.},

In a 1,500-2,500-m depth range off New Jersey and Delaware, 233 30 x 30-cm samples contained 798 species in 171 families and 14 phyla. Addition of stations from sites to the north and south approximately doubled the number of samples and doubled the number of species to 1,597. Species-area curves do not level off within stations or when stations are added together. Moreover, the proportion of species represented by single individuals is high at all scales of sampling, which indicates that much more sampling is needed to adequately represent the species richness either locally or regionally. Diversity changes very little through time at a single site or with distance along a 180-km transect at a depth of 2,100 m. Diversity is maintained by a combination of biogenic microhabitat heterogeneity in a system with few barriers to dispersal, disturbance created by feeding activities of larger animals, and food resources divided into patches of a few square meters to square centimeters initiated by specific temporally separated events.}

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

We collected samples of mesopelagic species down to a depth of 600 m, studied fish behaviour, identified and quantified the species composition of the catches, analysed the chemical composition of the catch samples, and evaluated the presence of unwanted substances. Results showed that Maurolicus muelleri (Mueller's pearlside) and Benthosema glaciale (Glacier lantern fish) were the most abundant fish species in our samples and catches containing 80\% fish can be a good source of protein and marine lipids including eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3). Unwanted substances, except for Cd and As, were present at levels far lower than the limits set by European Union regulations. However, our experiments identified challenges that may limit the efficiency of commercial operations in the Northeast Atlantic. Combined real-time optical and/or multifrequency acoustic systems will be needed to improve species identification and ensure cost-effective fishing operations. Also, selective trawls that target only fish and release unwanted species are needed to secure high-quality oils and proteins.},

Stable nitrogen isotope analysis supported this and indicated that E. vallentini juveniles occupied a similar trophic position to that of the copepod (mean {$\delta$}15N values of 2.38 and 1.72 \textperthousand{} respectively). E. vallentini adults were found to be omnivorous, but the contribution of carnivory to the diet was difficult to determine. High phytoplankton and low mesozooplankton contributions to the diet from the gut content analysis suggested a predominantly herbivorous diet. However, the stable nitrogen isotope results showed that E. vallentini adults were closely grouped with T. gaudichaudi (mean {$\delta$}15N values of 3.66 and 4.13 \textperthousand{} respectively), indicating a high degree of omnivory and a relatively large heterotrophic contribution to the diet. Irrespective of the degree of carnivory, a dietary shift with an increase in size was evident for this species. The gut content analysis of E. longirostris showed that this species consumed large amounts of both phytoplankton and metazoan prey. However, the stable nitrogen isotope analysis indicated a high degree of carnivory (mean {$\delta$}15N = 6.88 \textperthousand ). Although the gut content analysis showed that N. megalops had a lower contribution of mesozooplankton to the diet compared to that of E. longirostris, the stable isotope analysis showed that these 2 species occupied a similar position (N. megalops mean {$\delta$}15N = 6.83 \textperthousand ). The findings of this study support findings in the literature and show that E. vallentini juveniles are herbivorous and N. megalops adults are carnivorous. However, adults of E. vallentini and E. longirostris appear to have higher contributions of heterotrophic carbon to their diets than has been assumed and may occupy higher trophic positions than initially predicted.},

The GSFM provides quantitative assessments of differences between passive and active margins: continental shelf width of passive margins (88 km) is nearly three times that of active margins (31 km); the average width of active slopes (36 km) is less than the average width of passive margin slopes (46 km); active margin slopes contain an area of 3.4 million km2 where the gradient exceeds 5\textdegree, compared with 1.3 million km2 on passive margin slopes; the continental rise covers 27 million km2 adjacent to passive margins and less than 2.3 million km2 adjacent to active margins. Examples of specific applications of the GSFM are presented to show that: 1) larger rift valley segments are generally associated with slow-spreading rates and smaller rift valley segments are associated with fast spreading; 2) polar submarine canyons are twice the average size of non-polar canyons and abyssal polar regions exhibit lower seafloor roughness than non-polar regions, expressed as spatially extensive fan, rise and abyssal plain sediment deposits \textemdash{} all of which are attributed here to the effects of continental glaciations; and 3) recognition of seamounts as a separate category of feature from ridges results in a lower estimate of seamount number compared with estimates of previous workers.},

  abstract = {Material collected in summer 2004 from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Iceland and the Azores with three pelagic trawls was used to estimate relative catchabilities of common fish, cephalopod, decapod, and jellyfish species. Catchability is defined as the ratio of numbers caught between two trawls, standardized for towed distance. Taxon-specific catchability coefficients were estimated for two large pelagic trawls with graded meshes, using a smaller pelagic trawl with a uniform mesh size as the reference trawl. Two of the trawls were equipped with multiple opening \textendash{} closing codends that allowed sampling of different depth layers. Generalized linear and mixed models suggest that most of the taxa have catchabilities much lower than expected from the area of opening alone, indicating that only a few species are herded by the large mesh at the mouth of larger trawls. Catchability coefficients across taxa show a very large spread, indicating that the sampled volume for the larger trawls with graded meshes was highly taxon-specific. Part of this variability can be explained by body size and taxonomic group, the latter probably reflecting differences in body form and behaviour. The catchability estimates presented here form the basis for combining data for quantitative analyses of community structure.},

  abstract = {Recent estimates suggest that the mesopelagic zone could contain a total fish biomass of 2-19.5 gigatonnes, roughly equivalent to 100 times the annual catch of all existing fisheries. In addition to the possibility of direct consumption of mesopelagic species, there is interest in their use for fishmeal, as a source of dietary supplements for humans, and to bio-prospect pharmaceuticals. All of this, and the demands for a global food supply that can feed an ever-growing population, has driven interest in the mesopelagic. Thus, accurate quantification of the biomass of mesopelagic resources, their nutritional and genetic composition, their links to other components of the food web, to other oceanic realms and to biological and chemical oceanographic processes and cycles, are the focus of growing research activity. This information is needed to ensure the sustainable management of these resources. In this introduction, we summarize the contributions included in this theme set and provide some ``food for thought'' on the state-of-the-art in research on the mesopelagic, including identifying the knowledge that must be generated to support its sustainable management (e.g. the effect that extracting significant biomass might have on the pelagic ecosystem and the flow of material and energy through it).},

  abstract = {Stable isotope analysis of fish tissue can aid studies of deep-sea food webs because sampling difficulties severely limit sample sizes of fish for traditional diet studies. The carbon stable isotope ratio (d13C) is widely used in food web studies, but it must be corrected to remove variability associated with varying lipid content in the tissue. A lipid correction has not been determined for any deep-sea fish. These fishes are ideal for studying lipid correction because lipid content varies widely among species. Our objective was to evaluate an application of a mass balance d13C correction to a taxonomically diverse group of deep-sea fishes by determining the effect of lipid extraction on the stable isotope ratios, examining the quality of the model parameters derived for the mass balance correction, and comparing the correction to published results. We measured the lipid extraction effect on the nitrogen stable isotope ratio (d15N) and d13C of muscle tissue from 30 North Atlantic species. Lipid extraction significantly increased tissue d15N ( + 0.66\%) and d13C values, but the treatment effect on d13C was dependent on C:N, a proxy for lipid content. We compared the lipid-extracted d13C to the d13C predicted by the mass balance correction using model variables estimated from either all individuals (pooled) or species-by-species or using published values from other species. The correction using the species-by-species approach performed best; however, all three approaches produced corrected values that were generally within 0.5\% of the measured lipid-free d13C and that had a small over-all bias ( o0.5\%). We conclude that a generalized mass balance correction works well for correcting d13C in deep-sea fishes, is similar to that developed for other fishes, and recommend caution when applying a generalized correction to fish with high lipid content (C:N 4 8).},

Cluster-analyses of vertical distribution information and diet characteristics revealed that while large groups of species overlapped ({$>$}60\%) in either vertical distributions or diet, when both niche parameters were considered together, little interspecific or intraspecific (size class) overlap occurred. Our data suggest that for myctophids, trophic competition is reduced through resource-partitioning, although with considerable overlap at niche boundaries. Niche separation presumably is the result of competition during the evolution of the ecosystem and is maintained presently as "diffuse competition": the effect on a species of the combined competition from all other species at that trophic level. We suggest that the large degree of niche overlap enables the "packing" of over 50 myctophid species in the epipelagic zone at night. Our calculations indicate that myctophid predation nightly removes 2\% of the zooplankton biomass. Myctophid predation is selective in that greatest pressure is on certain size classes and types of prey (copepods, ostracods and euphausiids). In the case of copepods, impact is greatest on the larger, more mature stages and hence on the breeding population. It is estimated that myctophids account for at least one-third of the daily production of zooplankton removed from the epipelagic zone by micronekton in the eastern Gulf.},

  abstract = {Comprehension of ecological processes in marine animals requires information regarding dynamic vertical habitat use. While many pelagic predators primarily associate with epipelagic waters, some species routinely dive beyond the deep scattering layer. Actuation for exploiting these aphotic habitats remains largely unknown. Recent telemetry data from oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) in the Atlantic show a strong association with warm waters ({$>$}20\textdegree C) less than 200 m. Yet, individuals regularly exhibit excursions into the meso- and bathypelagic zone. In order to examine deep-diving behavior in oceanic whitetip sharks, we physically recovered 16 pop-up satellite archival tags and analyzed the high-resolution depth and temperature data. Diving behavior was evaluated in the context of plausible functional behavior hypotheses including interactive behaviors, energy conservation, thermoregulation, navigation, and foraging. Mesopelagic excursions (n = 610) occurred throughout the entire migratory circuit in all individuals, with no indication of site specificity. Six depth-versus-time descent and ascent profiles were identified. Descent profile shapes showed little association with examined environmental variables. Contrastingly, ascent profile shapes were related to environmental factors and appear to represent unique behavioral responses to abiotic conditions present at the dive apex. However, environmental conditions may not be the sole factors influencing ascents, as ascent mode may be linked to intentional behaviors. While dive functionality remains unconfirmed, our study suggests that mesopelagic excursions relate to active foraging behavior or navigation. Dive timing, prey constituents, and dive shape support foraging as the most viable hypothesis for mesopelagic excursions, indicating that the oceanic whitetip shark may regularly survey extreme environments (deep depths, low temperatures) as a foraging strategy. At the apex of these deep-water excursions, sharks exhibit a variable behavioral response, perhaps, indicating the presence or absence of prey.},

Forty taxa or morphotypes of mesopelagic fish larvae were identified. Skinnycheek Lanternfish Benthosema pterotum (19.1\%), Bristlemouth Cyclothone alba (11.6\%), Spinycheek Lanternfish B. fibulatum (10.8\%), Benthosema spp. (9.4\%), and Neoscopelus spp. (9.2\%) were the five predominant taxa. Maximum abundance of these taxa generally occurred during the cold period (winter and spring). Although the temporal difference in the abundance of mesopelagic fish larvae was not significant, the assemblage of mesopelagic fish larvae was more diverse in winter than in other seasons. Cluster and distance-based linear model analysis suggested a distinctly structured assemblage of mesopelagic fish larvae. The intrusion of the Kuroshio Branch Current played an important role in the transport of mesopelagic fish larvae. The distribution of mesopelagic fish larvae was closely related to the hydrographic features, with surface temperature and mixed-layer depth being the major factors affecting the occurrence of mesopelagic fish larvae. Also, the vertical mixing of the water column in winter induced the vertical distribution of natural food favorable for mesopelagic fish larvae.},

Through their significant diel vertical migrations and metabolism they also have the potential to be a significant contributor to carbon export. We investigated the feeding ecology and contribution to organic carbon export by three myctophid species, Benthosema glaciale, Protomyctophum arcticum, and Hygophum hygomii, from a structurally and ecologically unique ecosystem- the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Similar to the results of previous studies, the diet of these fishes was primarily copepods and euphausiids, however, gelatinous zooplankton was identified in the diet of B. glaciale for the first time. Ridge section and time of day were significant explanatory variables in the diet of B. glaciale as determined by canonical correspondence analysis, while depth was the only significant explanatory variable in the diet of P. arcticum. Daily consumption by MAR myctophids was less than 1\% of dry body weight per day and resulted in the removal of less than 1\% of zooplankton biomass daily. Although lower than previous estimates of carbon transport by myctophids and zooplankton in other areas, MAR myctophid active transport by diel vertical migration was equivalent to up to 8\% of sinking particulate organic carbon in the North Atlantic. While highly abundant, myctophids do not impart significant predation pressure on MAR zooplankton, and play a modest role in the active transport of carbon from surface waters.},

Fifty-one species were taken in the eastern South Atlantic and 17 species in the eastern North Atlantic. Analyses of the samples included clustering and multi-dimensional scaling ordination of the root-root transformed densities using the Bray-Curtis similarity index. In the eastern South Atlantic (March 1988), where the horizontal and vertical temperature structuring of the water column was marked, oceanic myctophids were not taken shallower than the 300 mdepth horizon and less than one-third of the total number of species occurred inside the 500 m-depth horizon. Temperatures and bottom depths correlated with the downslope distributions of the species. Down-slope zonation was apparent. In the eastern North Atlantic (May 1983), where the temperature structure of the water column was similar at all stations, no oceanic species were taken at the 200 m-depth horizon and more than one-half of the total number of species was taken at the 300 m-depth horizon. Species distributions correlated with depth, and downslope zonation was not evident. The data sets, as well as information from the West Florida slope, suggest that both the depth and the regional temperature structure of the water column effect the upper slope distributions of oceanic myctophids. Long-slope, ribbon distribution patterns (generalized down-slope zonation) in myctophids may therefore be localized artifacts produced by the interaction of these factors.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the food web structure of the oligotrophic picophytoplankton-dominated pelagic ecosystem in the vicinity of New Caledonia, within the Archipelagic Deep Basin (ARCH) province of the southwest sub-tropical Pacific. Nitrogen stable isotope ({$\delta$}15N) data were collected for mesozooplankton (0.2\textendash 2 mm), macrozooplankton (2\textendash 20 mm), micronekton (20\textendash 200 mm) and nekton (4 200 mm) during 2002\textendash 2004 and 2011. Using a coupled {$\delta$}15N size-spectrum approach, we estimated (1) organism trophic level (TL); (2) food chain length (FCL); (3) predator prey mass ratio (PPMR); and (4) transfer efficiency (TE). The role of phytoplankton size structure in determining these parameters was investigated. Applying a trophic enrichment factor (TEF) of 3.4, maximum TL was calculated at \$ 5. The number of TLs spanned by each length class was 1.97 for mesozooplankton, 2.07 for macrozooplankton, 2.75 for micronekton, and 2.21 for nekton. Estimated PPMR was 10,099:1 for mesozooplankton, 3683:1 for macrozooplankton/micronekton, and 2.44 \^A 105:1 for nekton, corresponding to TEs of 6.3\%, 8.5\% and 2.4\%, respectively. PPMR and TE were strongly influenced by the TEF used, and TEF 3.4 likely over and underestimated PPMR and TE, respectively, for mesozooplankton and macrozooplankton/micronekton. Comparatively low PPMR for mesozooplankton and macrozooplankton/micronekton indicated longer food chains and higher connectivity within these groups than for the nekton. Conversely, the high PPMR yet high trophic niche width for the nekton indicated that they prey primarily on macrozooplankton/ micronekton, with a relatively high degree of dietary specialisation. Our results are discussed in the context of other marine food webs. The ARCH food chain was found to be 1\textendash 1.5 trophic levels longer than the eutrophic micro-/nanophytoplankton-dominated Californian upwelling system, providing empirical support for the role of phytoplankton size in determining FCL. Group specific PPMR estimates demonstrated that it is changes in trophic pathways across the mesozooplankton/macrozooplankton/ micronekton groups that are primarily responsible for higher FCL under oligotrophic conditions. Finally, we discuss consistently low {$\delta$}15N values to the east of New Caledonia, and implications for the contribution of diazotroph nitrogen to the pelagic food web in this region.},

  abstract = {The Kerguelen Plateau is a region of natural iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean, within the typically iron limited High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) waters of the eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Between 26 February and 19 March 2018, the MOBYDICK expedition investigated pelagic ecosystem dynamics in the Kerguelen Island region on the northern plateau during the post-phytoplankton bloom period. The survey specifically targeted sampling at two stations in the HNLC waters to the west of the Kerguelen Plateau, and in the iron enriched waters on and to the east of the plateau. A combination of WP2, WP3 and Mesopelagos midwater trawl were used to sample the mesozooplankton (125 {$\mu$}m to {$\leq$} 10 mm), macrozooplankton (10\textendash 30 mm) and micronekton ({$>$} 30 to 200 mm) communities. Stable carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) isotopes were measured across representative samples of taxa from all stations. Trophic positions was estimated using a Bayesian isotope mixing model (tRophicPosition), that uses both the {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of baselines and consumers. Meso/ macrozooplankton trophic positions (TPs) were \textasciitilde{} 2.4 on the plateau and {$>$} 0.6 TPs higher at the upstream HNLC stations. This provides empirical evidence for shorter food chains on the diatom dominated plateau and longer food chains in the HNLC region dominated by pico and nanophytopklankon. Meso/macrozooplankton TPs were also elevated downstream of the plateau, though to a lesser extent than in the upstream region, likely reflecting the effect of downstream iron transport, supporting elevated phytoplankton production in the downstream re\- gion. There was a consistent increase in trophic position between meso/macrozooplankton and micronekton of \textasciitilde{} 0.6 at all stations. Food chain length was therefore determined by the composition of and interactions between the trophic levels below micronekton. Similar trophic structure at the two upstream HNLC stations, on either side of the northern branch of the Polar Front, indicated that food chain length was robust to the differences in community composition, and supports the critical role of size structured trophic interactions in determining food web properties.},

It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species?number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or 'species composition parameters' having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ?1=[n/n?1][1?{$\Sigma$}i(N\_i/\_N)2] =the proportion of potential interindividual encounters which is interspecific (as opposed to intraspecific), assuming every individual in the collection can encounter all other individuals, E(Sn) = {$\Sigma$}i [1?(N?Nin)/(Nn)] =the expected number of species in a sample of n individuals selected at random from a collection containing N individuals, S species, and Ni individuals in the ith species.}

Nitrogen stable isotopes (d15N) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP but are limited by a pragmatic assumption that isotope discrimination is constant (change in d15N between predator and prey, D15N = 3.4\&), resulting in an additive framework that omits known D15N variation. Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental D15N and d15N values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled D15N framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator TP estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified. The scaled D15N framework will greatly improve the accuracy of trophic estimates widely used in ecosystem-based management.},

  abstract = {The North Fiji Basin is one of the active marginal basins in the southwestern Pacific. Hydrothermal fluid emanations were located at two sites on the Central ridge of the basin. High-temperature fluids (230-290 degrees C) venting from anhydrite chimneys at a 17 degrees S site have end-member compositions of: 11.0-14.5 mmol/kg of CO2; 30.4-43.5 mu mol/kg of CH4; and 2.3-4.5 X 10(-5) cm(3)STP/g of He. Taking phase separation processes into account, the gas abundances are not enriched compared with the mid-oceanic ridge hydrothermal systems. Isotopic compositions of CO2 (delta(13)C=-6.2 to -5.7 parts per thousand PDB), CH4 (delta(13)C=-20 to -18 parts per thousand PDB), and helium (R/R(A)=9.0-10.0) are comparable to the mid-oceanic ridge signature. Together with basalt helium data, the helium isotopic signature may be attributed to the incorporation of a hotspot-like primitive component. Low-temperature shimmering fluids (the highest measured temperature was 5.2 degrees C) associated with biological communities at a site at 18 degrees 50'S show slight chemical anomalies, in some species, in SiO2, Mn, Li, pH and CH4, and helium isotope ratios distinct from ambient seawater. Evaluated helium isotopic compositions prior to dilution fall between R/R(A) = 8.4 and 8.9, supporting the suggestion of high-temperature hydrothermal activity at this site, although this was not observed by dive expeditions. The gas geochemistry of these two different types of fluids show several similar characteristics to the mid-oceanic ridge hydrothermal systems. This result is in accordance with previous petrological studies which demonstrated a dominant N-MORB source signature and a co-existing OIB source influence of the North Fiji Basin magmatism.}

Although relationships between species composition, their traits, and the environment have been extensively studied on a case-by-case basis, results are variable, and it remains unclear how generalizable these relationships are across ecosystems, taxa and spatial scales. To address this gap, we collated 80 datasets from trait-based studies into a global database for               metaCommunity Ecology: Species, Traits, Environment and Space               ; ``CESTES''. Each dataset includes four matrices: species community abundances or presences/absences across multiple sites, species trait information, environmental variables and spatial coordinates of the sampling sites. The CESTES database is a live database: it will be maintained and expanded in the future as new datasets become available. By its harmonized structure, and the diversity of ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, and spatial scales it covers, the CESTES database provides an important opportunity for synthetic trait-based research in community ecology.},

  abstract = {Continuous measurements of sulfide, silicate and temperature were made in situ from the submersible Alvin in the Rose Garden and New Vent hydrothermal fields of the Galapagos Spreading Center. Continuous measurements of temperature also were made for an 18 day period in the Rose Garden field. The results demonstrate several adaptations that appear to have contributed to the success of the vent mussel Bathymodiolus thermophilus in the Rose Garden. Dense clusters of B. thermophilus can disperse the hydrothermal fluids laterally for distances of several meters. This results in a large increase in the area of the redox transition zone, where both dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are available. As a result, the animal communities can grow to occupy areas that would not otherwise provide adequate reduced substrates. Measurements of the temperature demonstrate a distinct tidal periodicity. This periodicity Will result in a large range of environmental conditions within the vent community. The mussel can tolerate these wide ranges in condition because of its ability to accept long periods of anoxia and to filter feed.}

To assess the validity of the hypotheses, we examined two nuclear (18S and 28S rRNA) and two mitochondrial genes (COI and ND4) from a broad array of bathymodiolin species that included several recently discovered species from shallow hydrothermal seamounts. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and maximum-likelihood estimates of ancestral character states revealed that vent species evolved multiple times, and that reversals in vent and seep habitat use occurred within the sampled taxa. Previous hypotheses regarding evolution from wood/bone-to-seeps/vents are supported in that mid-ocean hydrothermal vent species may represent a monophyletic group with one noticeable reversal. Earlier hypotheses about progressive evolution from shallow-to-deep habitats appear to hold with a few instances of habitat reversals.}

This study examines the feeding relationships of three common slickhead species from approximately 1000 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand: Alepocephalus antipodianus (Parrot, 1948), A. australis (Barnard, 1923), and Xenodermichthys copei (Gill, 1884). The Alepocephalus species were predominantly benthopelagic feeders with a small benthic component to their diets. Alepocephalus australis fed on pelagic tunicates, notably Pyrosoma atlanticum P\'eron, 1804. Alepocephalus antipodianus fed on fish and pelagic tunicates, and also crustaceans. Xenodermichthys copei fed primarily on crustaceans. Considerable material was recovered from the intestines of all three species, and much of it was identifiable and only partially digested, including the remains of pelagic tunicates. There was little dietary overlap between the stomach contents of the three slickhead species indicating a degree of niche partitioning. Intestinal contents differed from stomach contents in weight, but not in number of items for all three species. The composition of stomach and intestinal contents differed for A. australis, but not for A. antipodianus or X. copei, which suggests that intestinal contents could be potentially useful in lieu of stomach content. There was a high level of overlap between the intestinal contents of A. antipodianus and A. australis, suggesting a possible closer dietary relationship between these two species than that indicated by stomach contents alone. Despite limitations in sample size and spatial and temporal coverage, the results from this study indicate that the three slickhead species could play an important role in the structuring of the demersal community at mid-slope depths on northeastern Chatham Rise.},

The study focused on SLs made up of the lightfish Maurolicus muelleri and the lanternfish Benthosema glaciale. Individual fish migrated in a pronounced stepwise manner, alternating between vertical movements and stationary phases both during ascent and descent. Mean lengths of steps varied between 2.01 and 0.40 m, and mean duration of stationary phases between 69 and 36 s for fish in different SLs. Such travel-pause behavior concords with saltatory search, where fish scan the water for prey during the stationary phases, relocate and scan a new water parcel. Little activity was recorded among individuals in deep water, apart from infrequent, short shifts in vertical distribution. This study shows that stationary submerged echo sounders can provide detailed information on in situ behavior of mesopelagic fish.},

The current global estimate based on net sampling prior to 1980 suggests a global abundance of one gigatonne (109 t) wet weight. Here we report novel evidence of efficient avoidance of such sampling by the most common myctophid fish in the Northern Atlantic, i.e. Benthosema glaciale. We reason that similar avoidance of nets may explain consistently higher acoustic abundance estimates of mesopelagic fish from different parts of the world's oceans. It appears that mesopelagic fish abundance may be underestimated by one order of magnitude, suggesting that the role of mesopelagic fish in the oceans might need to be revised.},

Rather than confining the twilight zone to a certain depth interval, we here propose a definition that covers absolute light intensities ranging from 10\`A9 to 10\`A1 lmol quanta m\`A2 s\`A1. The lowest intensity of this twilight habitat corresponds to the visual threshold of lanternfishes (Myctophidae). The highest intensity corresponds to the upper light exposure of pearlsides (Maurolicus spp.), which have a unique eye adapted to higher light intensities than the lanternfishes. By this definition, the daytime twilight habitat extends deeper than 1000 m in very clear oceanic water, while may even be largely located above 200 m in very murky coastal waters. During moonlit nights in clear water, the twilight habitat would still extend deep into the mesopelagic depth zone, while becoming compressed toward the surface in dark nights. Large variation in night light, from 10\`A3 lmol quanta m\`A2 s\`A1 during moonlit nights to 10\`A8 lmol quanta m\`A2 s\`A1 in dark overcast nights, implies that division of light into night- and daylight is insufficient to characterize the habitats and distributional patterns of twilight organisms. Future research will benefit from in situ light measurements, during night- as well as daytime, and habitat classification based on optical properties in addition to depth. We suggest some pertinent research questions for future exploration of the twilight zone.},

  abstract = {We used extensive ecological and biogeochemical measurements obtained from quasi-Lagrangian experiments during two California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecosystem Research cruises to analyze carbon fluxes between the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones using a linear inverse ecosystem model (LIEM). Measurement constraints on the model include 14C primary productivity, dilution-based microzooplankton grazing rates, gut pigment-based mesozooplankton grazing rates (on multiple zooplankton size classes), 234Th:238U disequilibrium and sediment trap measured carbon export, and metabolic requirements of micronekton, zooplankton, and bacteria. A likelihood approach (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) was used to estimate the resulting flow uncertainties from a sample of potential flux networks. Results highlight the importance of mesozooplankton active transport (i.e., diel vertical migration) in supplying the carbon demand of mesopelagic organisms and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In nine water parcels ranging from a coastal bloom to offshore oligotrophic conditions, mesozooplankton active transport accounted for 18\textendash 84\% (median: 42\%) of the total carbon transfer to the mesopelagic, with gravitational settling of POC (12\textendash 55\%; median: 37\%), and subduction (2\textendash 32\%; median: 14\%) providing the majority of the remainder. Vertically migrating zooplankton contributed to downward carbon flux through respiration and excretion at depth and via mortality losses to predatory zooplankton and mesopelagic fish (e.g., myctophids and gonostomatids). Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the LIEM were robust to changes in nekton metabolic demand, rates of bacterial production, and mesozooplankton gross growth efficiency. This analysis suggests that prior estimates of zooplankton active transport based on conservative estimates of standard (rather than active) metabolism are likely too low.},

The fish assemblage in the canyon was highly diverse but 20 species together comprised more than 90\% of the catch by number and 80\% by weight. The most numerous was the gonostomatid Cyclothone microdon while the myctophid Benthosema glaciale was next in number and first in weight. Most of those principal species would be expected in catches taken in oceanic waters beyond the shelf break. Only the bottom-spawning Melanostigma atlanticum was, within the surveyed area, distinctively a species of the canyon. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary variations in the assemblage were aligned with drivers that act in open ocean: depth, water mass and both diel and seasonal cycles. However, the effect of the canyon was evident in an up-canyon decline in the catches of most species. We hypothesize that the oceanic species are passively carried into The Gully by the known inflow and are there exposed to intense predation, depleting their numbers. We estimate that biomass flux as sufficient to support the Marine Protected Area's signature species: northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus).},

Larvae were found, however, throughout all seasons, suggesting that some had overwintered. The highest abundance (5.8 individuals m\textendash 2) of larvae was in summer. During summer and autumn, hatching mainly occurred at 100\textendash 150-m depth and larvae migrated toward the surface with growth. Once larvae reached about 20 mm in length, they moved below 100 m, and larger larvae (over 24 mm) exhibited diel vertical migration. The abundance of juveniles integrated through the water column was relatively constant (0.3 individuals m\textendash 2) throughout the study period. They were collected from below 300 m during the day, and part of the population (13\textendash 38\%) swam into the epipelagic layer at night. The information on early stages of L. schmidti presented here provides a basis for future investigations of mesopelagic fish ecology in oceanic areas of the western subarctic North Pacific Ocean.},

We analysed vertical distribution and diel vertical migration (DVM) of mesopelagic acoustic scattering layers (SLs) recorded at 38\,kHz across oceanographic regimes encountered during the circumglobal Malaspina expedition. Mesopelagic SLs were observed in all areas covered, but vertical distributions and DVM patterns varied markedly. The distribution of mesopelagic backscatter was deepest in the southern Indian Ocean (weighted mean daytime depth: WMD 590\,m) and shallowest at the oxygen minimum zone in the eastern Pacific (WMD 350\,m). DVM was evident in all areas covered, on average \textasciitilde 50\% of mesopelagic backscatter made daily excursions from mesopelagic depths to shallow waters. There were marked differences in migrating proportions between the regions, ranging from \textasciitilde 20\% in the Indian Ocean to \textasciitilde 90\% in the Eastern Pacific. Overall the data suggest strong spatial gradients in mesopelagic DVM patterns, with implied ecological and biogeochemical consequences. Our results suggest that parts of this spatial variability can be explained by horizontal patterns in physical-chemical properties of water masses, such as oxygen, temperature and turbidity.},

Continuous underway acoustics mapped vertical and horizontal distributions, and trawl sampling provided data on biomass and taxonomic composition. The hull mounted acoustics and trawl catches suggested that, among the four basins, biomass of epipelagic, larger nektonic species ({$>$}20 cm length) during the cruise was highest in the NS and ICS basins, while mesopelagic non-gelatinous micronekton biomass peaked in the IRS and LS basins. Biomass of Scyphozoa was also about 1 order of magnitude higher in IRS and LS compared to ICS and NS. In ICS and NS, crustaceans made up about 50\% of total non-gelatinous micronekton biomass, with fish making up less than 20\% of total biomass. In contrast, fish constituted more than 60\% of non-gelatinous biomass of catches in IRS and LS. In catches from ICS and NS the myctophid Benthosema glaciale dominated the catches, whereas bathylagids, gonostomatids, barracudinas and stomiids contributed to the high biomass densities of fish in IRS and LS. In addition to the differences in biomass between the basins, the acoustic measurements suggested gradients within the north-eastern basins, and large differences in vertical distribution of biomass between the basins during the cruise.},

Distinct mesopelagic scattering layers were found in all basins, but the daytime depth of the layers varied between basins. The results suggested that daytime vertical distribution across the four basins are strongly influenced by optical conditions. DVM occurred in all basins, and since daytime vertical distribution was influenced by optical conditions, it affected the amplitude of vertical connectivity. We used the proportion of the acoustic backscatter that migrated vertically into the epipelagic zone as a proxy for active vertical flux to the mesopelagic. The proportion of micronekton backscatter participating in the vertical migrations varied between the basins, with the highest and lowest vertical connectivity in the Norwegian Sea and the Iceland Sea respectively. We conclude that a more than 8-fold reduction in backscatter flux in the Iceland Sea was primarily attributable to optical conditions there, as high nighttime light levels appeared to exclude the micronekton from the epipelagic zone.},

The micronekton fish are important forage for top predators (e.g. tunas), and information on their diversity, distribution, size-structure, and abundance is needed to increase accuracy of top-predator distribution and abundance predictions. At the scale of an ocean basin, four years of Tasman Sea transects using a fishing vessel provide fine-scale maps of acoustic backscatter at 38 kHz that reveal detailed spatial patterns and structure to depths of 1200 m. Research-vessel data provide detailed biodiversity, density, size structure, and acoustic-scattering information from depth-stratified net sampling and a lowered acoustic probe. Wet-weight biomass estimates of the micronekton fish in the region vary considerably by a factor of 5\textendash{} 58 between acoustics (16 \textendash{} 29 g m22), nets (1.6 g m22), and large spatial-scale, ecological models (0.5 \textendash 3 g m22).

  abstract = {Theoretical work predicts that complex habitats allow more species to co-exist in a given area. However, more field studies are still needed to clarify this relationship, especially in intertidal habitats. Furthermore, the potential separate effects of surface complexity and area on species richness and abundance have rarely been addressed. We tested the hypotheses that a more complex substratum or larger surface area will support a greater number of individuals and species of mobile macrofauna on three rocky shores in Hong Kong. Surface complexity, assessed by using fractals, was an important factor in species\textendash area relationships. The number of species increased proportionally to habitat complexity and this relationship was homogeneous among different shores. Total abundance of animals, however, was more dependent on the available surface area. The slope of the size\textendash frequency distribution of animals in samples taken on surfaces with different fractal dimensions (D) was significantly steeper with an increase in fractal dimension, showing that the relative abundance of small animals increased with surface complexity. Thus, surface complexity and area may be important in determining different aspects of the macrofaunal community structure on rocky shores. The resulting increase in surface area on more rough surfaces may introduce bias in density and species number assessments when two-dimensional sampling units (i.e., quadrats) are employed. It is necessary, therefore, to account for the surface complexity in the design and interpretation of the results of benthic studies. Using D as an index of surface complexity is very useful, but also involves some practical problems, e.g., surfaces may be anisotropic and different methods may give different estimates of D. Therefore, these different methods need to be calibrated before comparisons of D values between them are meaningful.},

  abstract = {Gonostoma elongatum is an important mesopelagic fish found throughout the world at subtropical-tropical latitudes. This study examined its distribution, abundance and life history in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The species was a strong diel migrator, found from 25 to 325 m at night and from 425 to 725 m during the day with small fish occurring shallorver than large fish. Numerical abundance and biomass were high, rivalling the dominant species of myctophids in the Gulf of Mexico. There were no obvious seasonal fluctuations in population abundance. G. elongatum is a protandric hermaphrodite whose population breeds throughout the year and females probably once a lifetime. Growth rate, based on 'daily' ring counts from otoliths, was linear (0.34mm d-l) and the largest fish (225 mm Standard Length) was estimated to live less than 2 yr G. elongatum feeds primarily on crustaceans, with copepods and ostracods dominating in early juvenile stages ({$<$}50 mm SL) and euphausiids in the larger sizes. Diet composition shows little apparent seasonal variation Size selectivity in feeding occurs, with G. elongatum preferentially ingesting medium to large zooplankton, a trend which becomes stronger with age. Taxonomic selectivity occurs as well in that this species preferentially feeds on conchoecid ostracods and copepods Pleuromamma spp. There is an obvious selection against non-crustacean prey. A cyclic feeding pattern was observed with most active feeding occurring in the 25 to 250 m zone at night. While G. elongatum has relatively little predation impact on one of its principal foods (Pleuromamma spp.) over the entire zone of occurrence of this prey genus, predation is substantial on large Pleuromamma ({$>$}3 mm) in certain depth zones (150 to 200 m) at night.},

  abstract = {Throughout the oceans, small fish and other micronekton migrate between daytime depths of several hundred meters and near-surface waters at night. These diel vertical migrations of mesopelagic organisms structure pelagic ecosystems through trophic interactions, and are a key element in the biological carbon pump. However, depth distributions and migration amplitude vary greatly. Suggested proximate causes of the migration such as oxygen, temperature, and light often correlate and therefore the causal underpinnings have remained unclear. Using mesopelagic fishes and the Norwegian Sea as a study system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that finds optimal migration patterns that we validate with acoustic observations along a latitudinal gradient. The model describes predation risk and bioenergetics, and maximizes expected energy surplus, a proxy for Darwinian fitness. The model allows us to disentangle the drivers of migration and make predictions about depth distribution and related fitness consequences along a latitudinal trajectory with strong gradients in environmental drivers and vertical distribution of scattering layers. We show that the model-predicted vertical migration of mesopelagic fishes matches that observed along this transect. For most situations, modelled mesopelagic fish behaviour can be well described by a light comfort zone near identical to that derived from observations. By selectively keeping light or temperature constant, the model reveals that temperature, in comparison with light, has little effect on depth distribution. We find that water clarity, which limits how deeply light can penetrate into the ocean, structures daytime depths, while surface light at night controlled the depth of nocturnal ascents.},

In this study, a seasonal comparison of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans was carried out in two contrasted regions of the Eastern North Atlantic, the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. Estimates were obtained in the two sub-regions (375,000 km{$^2$}) from large aerial surveys conducted in the winter (November 2011 to February 2012) and in the summer (May to August 2012). The most abundant species encountered in the Channel, the harbour porpoise, displayed strong seasonal variations in its distribution but a stable abundance (18,000 individuals, CV=30\%). In the Bay of Biscay, abundance and distribution patterns of common / striped dolphins varied from 285,000 individuals (95\% CI: 174,000\textendash 481,000) in the winter, preferentially distributed close to the shelf break, to 494,000 individuals (95\% CI: 342,000-719,000) distributed beyond the shelf break in summer. Baleen whales also exhibited an increase of their density in summer. Seasonal abundances of bottlenose dolphins were quite stable, with a large number of `pelagic' encounters offshore in winter. No significant seasonal difference was estimated for pilot whales and sperm whale. These surveys provided baseline estimates to inform policies to be developed, or for existing conservation instruments such as the Habitats Directive. In addition, our results supported the hypothesis of a shift in the summer distributions of some species such as harbour porpoise and minke whale in European waters.},

  abstract = {The responsiveness of benthic biological communities to climatic drivers and shifts makes them powerful indicators of biogeochemical and other environmental change in the oceans. In addition, benthic ecosystems have an economic value and are considered a vital marine resource. However deep-sea faunal dynamics and ecosystem functioning is not well defined. This has placed a higher priority in recent years on developing and sustaining long-term, time-series studies of benthic biodiversity, rate processes, and ecosystem change in deep-sea and extreme habitats. A few key long-term time-series sites exist across the global Ocean. Many of these sites are reviewed in this paper. However, much of the existing research is uncoordinated and the data collected are not integrated or standardized. This currently limits the use of these valuable datasets, which could be used for benthic modeling, global model validation and other societal benefits related to more effective and environmentally sustainable governance of human activities in the deep ocean. Furthermore, the time scales that can be studied within existing research frameworks are not currently sufficient to adequately address internationally-identified science priorities. These include assessing regional and global biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the links between climate, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In addition, the contribution of deep-sea ecosystems to global biogeochemical cycles and the potential alteration to ecosystem value and services due to anthropogenic activities is largely unknown. In order to maximize the societal benefit, biological time-series, in particular deep-sea sites, urgently require more coordination, integration, sustained funding and infrastructure. This is necessary to unify research methodologies, create synergies in the use of deep-sea technology, develop benthic models, and to stimulate more collaboration between programmes. National and international research organizations may provide a suitable framework within which further advances can be achieved. Only then will we better understand the goods and services provided by deep-sea ecosystems and the potential for environmentally sustainable exploitation of the deep ocean.}

Although some studies on the occurrence, biology and ecology of these organisms are available, to date there are no investigations on their potential use for anticancer and antimicrobial biotechnological applications. The aim of this study was to screen extracts of seven mesopelagic species for possible anticancer (Lung cell line A549, skin cell line A2058, liver cell line HepG2, breast cell line MCF7 and pancreas cell line MiaPaca-2) and antibacterial (Gram-negative bacteria               Escherichia coli               and               Klebsiella pneumoniae               , the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin resistant/sensitive               Staphylococcus aureus               , and               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               ) activities.

Regarding antibacterial assays, both species were active against methicillin resistant               S. aureus               . Fractionation and LC/MS dereplication of the fractions showed that the main compounds found in extracts of both species were EPA, DHA and ETA.

Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in d13C\textendash d15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.}

Here, we provide an example of a modeling approach with definitions of several pelagic mid-trophic functional groups. This application includes six different groups characterized by their vertical behavior, i.e., occurrence of diel migration between epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Parameterization of the dynamics of these components is based on a temperature-linked time development relationship. Estimated parameters of this relationship are close to those predicted by a model based on a theoretical description of the allocation of metabolic energy at the cellular level, and that predicts a species metabolic rate in terms of its body mass and temperature. Then, a simple energy transfer from primary production is used, justified by the existence of constant slopes in log\textendash log biomass size spectrum relationships. Recruitment, ageing, mortality and passive transport with horizontal currents, taking into account vertical behavior of organisms, are modeled by a system of advection\textendash diffusion-reaction equations. Temperature and currents averaged in each vertical layer are provided independently by an Ocean General Circulation Model and used to drive the mid-trophic level (MTL) model. Simulation outputs are presented for the tropical Pacific Ocean to illustrate how different temperature and oceanic circulation conditions result in spatial and temporal lags between regions of high primary production and regions of aggregation of mid-trophic biomass. Predicted biomasses are compared against available data. Data requirements to evaluate outputs of these types of models are discussed, as well as the prospects that they offer both for ecosystem models of lower and upper trophic levels.},

A detailed description of the biodiversity and community structure is needed to help understand the ecological processes that underlie the distribution and dynamics of deep-sea vent communities. Here, we assessed the composition, abundance, diversity and trophic structure of six tubeworm samples, corresponding to different successional stages, collected on the Grotto hydrothermal edifice (Main Endeavour Field, Juan de Fuca Ridge) at 2196\,m depth. Including R.~piscesae, a total of 36 macrofaunal taxa were identified to the species level. Although polychaetes made up the most diverse taxon, faunal densities were dominated by gastropods. Most tubeworm aggregations were numerically dominated by the gastropods Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus and polychaete Amphisamytha carldarei. The highest diversities were found in tubeworm aggregations characterised by the longest tubes (18.5\,{$\pm$}\,3.3\,cm). The high biomass of grazers and high resource partitioning at a small scale illustrates the importance of the diversity of free-living microbial communities in the maintenance of food webs. Although symbiont-bearing invertebrates R.~piscesae represented a large part of the total biomass, the low number of specialised predators on this potential food source suggests that its primary role lies in community structuring. Vent food webs did not appear to be organised through predator\textendash prey relationships. For example, although trophic structure complexity increased with ecological successional stages, showing a higher number of predators in the last stages, the food web structure itself did not change across assemblages. We suggest that environmental gradients provided by the biogenic structure of tubeworm bushes generate a multitude of ecological niches and contribute to the partitioning of nutritional resources, releasing communities from competition pressure for resources and thus allowing species to coexist.}

Our results suggest that diversity and habitat characteristics of the bycatch assemblages differ depending of the fishing mode. Thus, diversity was mostly explained by area and set type; being higher in fish aggregating devices (FAD) sets than School sets. Concretely, diversity seems to be directly related with the equatorial upwelling and the front system in FAD sets and with the Costa Rica Dome and the coastal upwelling of Panama induced by wind jets in School sets. Among environmental variables, temperature and chlorophyll were the most important predictors to describe the diversity of the bycatch assemblages.

The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of 108 modern shells of various bivalve species collected from cold seeps and hydrothermal vents were investigated in order to evaluate whether these parameters can provide information on environmental geochemical variability as well as on bivalve species and on the type of symbiotic bacteria present in their gills. The results show that the carbonate of bivalve shells from hydrothermal vents is characterized by abnormal positive delta C-13 values due to kinetic isotope effects, whereas the carbonate of bivalve shells from cold seeps exhibits positive as well as negative delta C-13 values suggesting that oxidized methane emitted by the seeping fluids may be incorporated in the shell. Comparison of the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of bivalve shells hosting different chemosymbiotic bacteria suggests that each type of symbiosis is associated with a specific environment and bivalve species, indicating that there is a strong physiological/metabolic control on the incorporation of stable isotopes during the biomineralization process.},

  abstract = {Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems host both symbiotic and non-symbiotic invertebrates. The non-symbiotic vent fauna is generally assumed to rely on free-living chemoautotrophic bacteria as their main food source but other sources such as detritus have recently been suggested to be a part of the invertebrate diets. Little is known about how food availability influences the distribution of vent organisms on a small scale. In addition, the feeding ecology and role of small, often numerically dominant invertebrates, the meiofauna is poorly understood at vents. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis to investigate the role of particulate detritus in the diets of macro- and meiobenthic invertebrates within three vent assemblages at Axial Volcano, Juan de Fuca Ridge, and Northeast Pacific. Particulate organic matter of a detrital origin became more important in the diet of invertebrates in assemblages typically associated with low-hydrothermal flow intensities. Meiobenthic species occupied several different feeding guilds and trophic levels in the assemblages investigated. We conclude that small-scale spatial variability in food sources is an important feature of vent food webs and that spatial patterns observed here and elsewhere are shaped by variations in hydrothermal discharge.}

The modality of 88 LDGs was examined visually and using Hartigan's dip statistic. We found 80 LDGs were bimodal (or not unimodal), two gradients were unimodal and six gradients were ambiguous. All species and genera, and 19 families among fish groups and depth zones had bimodal or not unimodal LDGs. The northern hemisphere mode had 2\textendash 6\% greater richness from species to order richness. Overall fish, the peak of richness shifted poleward across taxonomic levels, from 25 N for species to median 48 N for class and from 10 S for genus to 35 S for class. Temperature and salinity were significantly correlated with the LDG. Our findings using fish species ranges support previous analyses using species' occurrences, namely that the LDG of marine species is bimodal, by generalizing this to all taxonomic levels and depth zones. That the LDG with a dip near the equator supports the hypothesis that it is primarily temperature driven, and that the equator is already too hot for some species.},

Fishes and basal sources showed a broad range of {$\delta$}               15               N (fishes: 6.49\textendash 14.94\textperthousand; sources: 2.58\textendash 6.79\textperthousand ) and {$\delta$}               13               C values (fishes: -23.86 to -13.71\textperthousand; sources: -24.32 to -13.53\textperthousand ), while shrimps and crabs exhibited similar nitrogen and carbon ratios. Six trophic consumer groups were determined among zooplankton, crustaceans and fishes by SIA, with trophic pathways associated mostly with benthic sources. SCA results indicated a preference for benthic invertebrates, mainly worms, crabs and shrimps, as prey for the fish fauna, highlighting their importance in the food web. In overall, differences between SCA and the SIA approaches were observed, except for groups composed mainly for shrimps and some species of high {$\delta$}               15               N values, mostly piscivorous and zoobenthivores. Given the absence of regulation for bottom trawling activities in the area, the cumulative effects of trawling on population parameters, species composition, potentially decreasing the abundance of benthic preys (e.g., shrimps, worms and crabs) may lead to changes in the trophic structure potentially affect the food web and the sustainability of the fishery.},

They were reexamined with an improved deep-tow instrument in 1976. The features are 20\textendash 50 m wide, conical in section and generally elongate in plan, and arranged in parallel chains that are commonly 1\textendash 2 km long, and aligned parallel to the rise flank's fault-block relief. Their rough sides, sloping at 35\textendash 45\textdegree{} from sharp crests, are encrusted with thick deposits of manganese oxide. Manganese crusts also occur on the sea floor in 10\textendash 20 m wide stripes of high acoustic reflectivity which extend discontinuously for several kilometers, generally on the crests of low rises (sometimes linking the cones and ridges of a chain). Although they are structures of the 30 m thick sediment blanket rather than of the volcanic bedrock, many chains and stripes overlie minor bedrock faults, and their plan patterns mimic those of minor faults and fissures exposed and mapped at the present spreading axis. These landforms and bands of mineralization are interpreted as the result of precipitation around the discharge vents of an active hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust, though no plumes of modified bottom water were found above them. They seem to form only after the basaltic crust has been completely buried with sediment, even along the scarps at fault-block boundaries which are the likely sites of discharge on younger crust. Their existence demonstrates the ability of localized discharges to vent through a thin blanket of pelagic sediment, and their shapes and distribution patterns emphasize the importance of zones of fracturing for controlling the site and scale of circulation in the bedrock.}

Closely related genera Idas and Adipicola are associated with organic falls, ecosystems that have been suggested as potential evolutionary 'stepping stones' in the colonization of deeper and more sulphide-rich environments. Such a scenario should result from specializations to given environments from species with larger ecological niches. This study provides molecular-based evidence for the existence of two mussel species found both on sunken wood and bones. Each species specifically harbours one bacterial phylotype corresponding to thioautotrophic bacteria related to other bathymodiolin symbionts. Phylogenetic patterns between hosts and symbionts are partially congruent. However, active endocytosis and occurrences of minor symbiont lineages within species which are not their usual host suggest an environmental or horizontal rather than strictly vertical transmission of symbionts. Although the bacteria are close relatives, their localization is intracellular in one mussel species and extracellular in the other, suggesting that habitat choice is independent of the symbiont localization. The variation of bacterial densities in host tissues is related to the substrate on which specimens were sampled and could explain the abilities of host species to adapt to various substrates.}

The diel vertical migration of mesopelagic fish represents one, if not the largest, vertical migration of biomass on the planet, and is thus an important link between the euphotic zone, transporting carbon and other nutrients to global deep sea communities. Knowledge of how mesopelagic fish interact and distribute plastic as a marine contaminant is required as these populations have been identified as a potential global industrial fishery for fishmeal production. Ingestion of microplastic by mesopelagic fish in the Northeast Atlantic was studied. Approximately 11\% of the 761 fish examined had microplastics present in their digestive tracts. No clear difference in ingestion frequency was identified between species, location, migration behaviour, or time of capture. While ingesting microplastic may not negatively impact individual mesopelagic fish, the movement of mesopelagic fish from the euphotic zone to deeper waters could mediate transfer of microplastics to otherwise unexposed species and regions of the world's oceans.},

  abstract = {Vertical distribution patterns and relative abundance of mesopelagic fish species and other major taxonomic groups were investigated through vertically stratified trawl sampling and hydroacoustic analyses along the subtropical convergence zone from 52\textdegree{} W to 70\textdegree{} W in the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea. Persistent stationary layers and several migrating components of different scattering characteristics were detected. The results reveal varying vertical migration patterns, including different times of onset of diel vertical migration in different depths and a migrant pathway emerging daily from the lower deep scattering layer (DSL) at dusk and migrating through the upper DSL without affecting its composition. Fish species identification was made based on morphological characteristics and confirmed by genetic barcoding analyses of subsamples. In total, 5022 fish specimens from 27 families, 62 genera and 70 species were caught. In terms of relative abundance (A) and biomass (M), catches were dominated by species of the families Myctophidae (A=59.1\%, M=47.4\% of total fish catch) and Melamphaidae (A=22.5\%, M=17.1\%). Myctophidae and Stomiidae were the most species-rich families with 31 and 12 species, respectively. Catches at the two easternmost stations were dominated by Scopelogadus mizolepis and Nannobrachium cuprarium, while Bolinichthys photothorax and Ceratoscopelus warmingii were the most abundant species in catches from the two westernmost stations. This study provides insights into distribution and vertical migration behaviour of mesopelagic fish in the Sargasso Sea and adds to our understanding of the mesopelagic community in this large oceanic area.},

  abstract = {Our knowledge of the natural dynamics, including colonisation processes, of hydrothermal vent ecosystems is still scarce and limits our ability to predict their resilience to natural (volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal flow changes, etc.) or anthropogenic disturbances (deep-sea mining of seafloor massive sulfide deposits, for example). This fundamental knowledge is a prerequisite to assess the natural regeneration capacity of vent communities. To better document the environmental and biological processes governing the recolonisation of vent mussel assemblages, we designed an innovative experimental project based on an induced disturbance. These assemblages, located near the Montsegur hydrothermal edifice on the Lucky Strike (Mid-Atlantic Ridge), will be monitored in situ during two years following the disturbance. In 2017, a total of 16 quadrats, instrumented with temperature sensors, were deployed. Eight were cleared of all fauna, four were caged to assess the role of predators on recolonization processes and four additional ones were selected as reference sites. In 2018, video cameras will be installed on each quadrats. Different approaches will be carried out. A quantitative description (composition, diversity and biomass) of macrofaunal assemblages associated to the engineer species Bathymodiolus azoricus will inform on faunal recovery in relation to environmental conditions. Then, selected functional traits, such as trophic structure using stable isotopes ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N), reproductive status of the dominant species and population structure, will be analysed along the ecological succession process. This fundamental knowledge on the resilience of vent communities will help elaborate management and impact monitoring protocols and eventually, to propose active restoration methods to protect these ecosystems and the unique species they harbour.}

  abstract = {Functional innovations play major roles in constraining or contributing to the evolutionary diversification of organismal morphology. Among fish key innovations, bioluminescence is critical to the success of many deep-sea fishes. Understanding evolutionary dynamics of deep-sea fish lineages and the role bioluminescent light organs have on their evolution is a continuing effort of many deep-sea biologists. This study focused on assessing how bioluminescent structures involved with sexual communication may be impacting the evolution of body shape in the lanternfishes (Myctophiformes), a lineage of fishes possessing some of the most extensive sexual dimorphism in bioluminescent structures seen in deep-sea organisms. Results from this study using geometric morphometrics integrated with a phylogenetic hypothesis of lanternfish relationships suggest there is significant evolutionary modularity between the caudal peduncle and the rest of the body within lanternfishes. Our results also show that most lanternfish species lacking caudal light organs cluster together in morphospace (Diaphus, Hintonia, Neo\- scopelidae), possess enlarged headlight organs (Diaphus), and exhibit lower phylogenetic signal than species possessing caudal light organs. These results support the hypothesis that lanternfish body-shape evolution is influenced by selective pressures on their light-producing tail organs and that the importance of caudal light organs in lanternfish communication may result in differential selection on the caudal area in species that possess them. One possible interpretation for why lanternfishes without caudal light organs coalesce in morphospace may be that by removing the caudal light organ, natural selection would select for a lanternfish caudal morphology optimized for the physical landscape of the midwater that they live in, favoring more energy effi\- cient and slow sustained swimming styles.},

All four areas are characterised by distinctly different and well-documented oceanographic conditions, biogeographical affinities and fishing exploitation. The results showed clear differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean deep-sea fish fauna, not only in density, species richness and composition, but also in the structure of the biomass that constitutes these assemblages.

The present study examines the diets of the clupeoid, stomiatoid and salmonoid species occurring demersally and pelagically in the Rockall Trough to the west of Scotland and Ireland. Pelagic fish were collected between the surface and about 2 500-m depth between 1973 and 1978. Demersal fish were sampled at 250-m intervals of depths between 500- and 2 900-m depth during the years 1975 and 1981. Of the 28 species caught, 18 were strictly pelagic and dominated by the stomiatoids while five were strictly demersal. The remaining five species occurred in both the pelagic and demersal environment. The commonest clupeoid was Alepoeephalus bairdii, which is a dominant species within the demersal fish associations at depths of 750 to 1 250 m. This species, along with the deeper-living A. agassizi, and 3 other alepocephalid species feed primarily o n benthopelagic prey but also exploit the epibenthos. The stomiatoid species, such as Qvclothone microdon, C. braueri, Maurolieus muelleri and Arg/ropelecus hemigymnus, dominate the associations of pelagic fish in the Trough. They feed on different proportions of ostracods, copepods and amphipods. Of the salmonoids, only Argentina silus and Bathylagus euryops occurred commonly and both feed on benthopelagic fauna, the latter at much greater depths than the former. The principal factor acting to prevent direct competition between species is the modal centres of bathymetric distribution of the species. Other contributing factors are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Mesopelagic fishes represent an important component of the marine food web due to their global distributions, high abundances and ability to transport organic material throughout a large part of the water column. This study combined stable isotope (SIAs) and gut content analyses (GCAs) to characterize the trophic structure of mesopelagic fishes in the North-\-Central Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, this study examined whether mesopelagic fishes utilized chemosynthetic energy from cold seeps. Specimens were collected (9\textendash 25 August 2007) over three deep ({$>$}1,000 m) cold seeps at discrete depths (surface to 1,503 m) over the diurnal cycle. GCA classified 31 species (five families) of mesopelagic fishes into five feeding guilds: piscivores, large crustacean consumers, copepod consumers, generalists and mixed zooplanktivores. However, these guilds were less clearly defined based on stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) results, suggesting diets may be more mixed over longer time periods (weeks\textendash months) and across co-\-occurring species. Copepods were likely important for the majority of mesopelagic fishes, consistent with GCA (this study) and previous literature. MixSIAR results also identified non-\-crustacean prey items, including salps and pteropods, as potentially important prey items for mesopelagic fishes, including those fishes not analysed in GCA (Sternoptyx spp. and Melamphaidae). Salps and other soft-\-bodied species are often missed in GCAs. Mesopelagic fishes had {$\delta$}13C results consistent with particulate organic matter serving as the baseline organic carbon source, fueling up to three trophic levels. Fishes that undergo diel vertical migration were depleted in 15N relative to weak migrators, consistent with depth-\-specific isotope trends in sources and consumers, and assimilation of 15N-\-depleted organic matter in surface waters. Linear correlations between fish size and {$\delta$}15N values suggested ontogenetic changes in fish diets for several species. While there was no direct measure of mesopelagic fishes assimilating chemosynthetic material, detection of infrequent consumption of this food resource may be hindered by the assimilation of isotopically enriched photosynthetic organic matter. By utilizing multiple dietary metrics (e.g. GCA, {$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N, MixSIAR), this study better defined the trophic structure of mesopelagic fishes and allowed for insights on feeding, ultimately providing useful baseline information from which to track mesopelagic trophodynamics over time and space.},

Trait-based approaches can provide better insight than species-based (i.e. taxonomic) approaches into community assembly and ecosystem functioning, but comparing species and trait dynamics may reveal important patterns for understanding community responses to environmental change. Here, we used a 33-year database of fish monitoring to compare the spatio-temporal dynamics of taxonomic and trait structure in North Sea fish communities. We found that the majority of variation in both taxonomic and trait structure was explained by a pronounced spatial gradient, with distinct communities in the southern and northern North Sea related to depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and bed shear stress. Both taxonomic and trait structure changed significantly over time; however taxonomically, communities in the south and north diverged towards different species, becoming more dissimilar over time, yet they converged towards the same traits regardless of species differences. In particular, communities shifted towards smaller, faster growing species with higher thermal preferences and pelagic water column position. Although taxonomic structure changed over time, its spatial distribution remained relatively stable, whereas in trait structure, the southern zone of the North Sea shifted northward and expanded, leading to homogenization. Our findings suggest that global environmental change, notably climate warming, will lead to convergence towards traits more adapted for novel environments regardless of species composition.},

The oceanic circulation in the Mozambique Channel is dominated by mesoscale cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies which play a key role in biological processes of less-productive deep-sea ecosystems. We investigated the potential impact of mesoscale features on the {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of 32 taxa of micronekton. Fishes, squids, crustaceans and gelatinous organisms encompassed a wide range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps among species. Our results showed that mesoscale features did not really influence the isotopic signatures of the sampled organisms, although cyclonic eddies can occasionally impact the nitrogen signatures of micronekton. We show that {$\delta$}13C values were intermediate between standard offshore and nearshore signatures, suggesting that pelagic production in the Mozambique Channel could be partly supported by the transport and export of inorganic and organic particles from the Mozambican coast toward the offshore area. Trophic levels calculated from {$\delta$}15N values ranged from 2.6 to 4.2, showing that micronekton taxa can be tertiary consumers in the Mozambique Channel. Our findings evidenced clusters of micronektonic organisms according to their {$\delta$}15N or {$\delta$}13C isotopic signatures, but variations in stable isotope values reflect a complex set of embedded processes linked to physical mesoscale dynamics (rotational dynamics of eddies) and basic biology and ecology of micronektonic organisms (vertical habitat, migration pattern, dietary habits, body length) that are discussed with regard to the stable isotope method based on time-integrated assimilated food.},

  abstract = {The deep sea is among the largest, most biologically diverse, yet least-explored ecosystems on Earth. Baseline information on deep-sea biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem functioning and for detecting community changes. Here, we established a baseline of cephalopod community composition and distribution off Cabo Verde, an archipelago in the eastern tropical Atlantic. This baseline served to test the hypothesis that Cabo Verde is biogeographically separated from other Macaronesian archipelagos and allowed the identification of cephalopod species which may play a role in the Macaronesian carbon cycle and oceanic food web. To investigate cephalopod community composition, this study used 746 individual cephalopods obtained by nets (0\textendash 1000 m) and 52 cephalopod encounters during video surveys with either towed camera (0\textendash 2500 m) or manned submersible (0\textendash 375 m). Additionally, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding on 105 seawater samples (50\textendash 2500 m), using an 18S rRNA universal cephalopod primer pair, and a species-specific primer pair for               Taningia danae               resulted in the detection of 32 cephalopod taxa. When combined, the three methods detected a total of 87 taxa, including 47 distinct species. Each method contributed between 7 and 54\% of taxa that were not detected by the other methods, indicating that multiple methodological approaches are needed for optimal deep-sea cephalopod biodiversity assessments. This study documents the occurrences of six species and three genera for the first time in waters surrounding Cabo Verde. Video surveys and eDNA analysis detected               Taningia danae               recurrently (100\textendash 2500 m). eDNA metabarcoding proved to be a powerful tool for cephalopod biodiversity monitoring and complementary to traditional sampling methods. When also including literature records, Cabo Verde hosts at least 102 cephalopod taxa including 30 families and 64 benthic and pelagic species. The total number and species composition of Cabo Verde cephalopods is similar to the Canary Islands and Azores, two known cephalopod biodiversity hotspots, but the Cabo Verde octopus fauna seems to differ. Due to a range of life history characteristics, we hypothesize that the squids               Taningia danae               (Octopoteuthidae) and               Sthenoteuthis pteropus               (Ommastrephidae) are important in the carbon cycle of Macaronesia. As a cephalopod biodiversity hotspot Cabo Verde could function as a model region to investigate cephalopod biology and ecology in a rapidly changing Atlantic Ocean.},

One of the goals of the HYDROSNAKE cruise with the submersible Nautile was the exploration of the neovolcanic ridge of the Snake Pit, in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, 23\textdegree 22' N, and the study of the associated hydrothermal vents. During 10 dives at this site, geological observations, sulfides, basalts and fluids sampling, gravimetric measurements as weil as biological specimen collection were performed. A geological map of the are a was made at a 1/5,000 scale. It shows that the Snake Pit ridge is a constructional feature made up of pillow lavas and lava tubes, which was subsequently structured by faulting. Location of the hydrothermal sites is clearly dependant on tectonic accidents.}

Stomach content indicated that blue whiting mainly fed on Myctophidae fish, decapods and euphausids. Differences in diet were observed between areas and throughout the year, with a higher proportion of Myctophidae in individuals living over the shelf break (attaining values \textasciitilde{} 70\% weight) than over the slope (attaining values \textasciitilde{} 50\% weight). In both habitats Myc\- tophidae, a highly energetic prey, were mainly consumed in spring and summer, which might allow the species to recover energy reserves after the reproductive period and supply the energetic demands of the fast growth season. MixSIAR models, which provide estimates of the relative contribution of each prey to the diet of the consumer by combining stable isotope values of the consumer with those of their potential prey, also indicated that Myctophidae were the main prey in the assimilated diet over the entire year, in both areas. The trophic niche, measured by isotope analyses, suggested segregation between individuals of the shelf break (mainly immatures) and the slope (mainly adults), which would reduce the intraspecific competition. The seasonal and spatial differences observed in the feeding ecology of the Mediterranean blue whiting are related to the energetic requirements of the species throughout the year and with changes in the spatial distribution of the different ontogenetic phases.},

The prey of S. nannochir was mainly copepods, but the species were different from those preyed on by D. theta and S. leucopsarus. D. theta fed on euphausiids, with 1 feeding peak during the daytime and another at night, but fed on amphipods only at night and on copepods throughout the entire diel cycle. The vertical migratory component of S. leucopsarus showed a significant diel feeding periodicity, feeding on euphausiids, copepods, and amphipods from dusk to midnight, while the non-migratory component did not feed actively at nighttime, and had a high frequency of empty stomachs. The non-migratory S. nannochir showed no diel feeding periodicity. The average ratio of stomach content weight/body weight was 2.2\% during the day and 2.0\% at night in D. theta, 0.8\% during the daytime and 1.1\% at night in the migratory S. leucopsarus, 0.6\% at night in the nonmigratory S. leucopsarus, and 0.07 to 0.13\% (avg. 0.11\%) in S. nannochir.},

Mesopelagic fish may be vulnerable to deep entrained oil plumes of the type seen in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill; even at low concentrations, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may cause lethal and sublethal effects, such as endocrine disruption, growth inhibition, and genetic damage. A reduction in the abundance of mesopelagic fish could potentially shift predation pressure by large pelagics to epipelagic forage or other species, with potential fisheries consequences. We explored this hypothesis on the West Florida Shelf using an Atlantis model for the Gulf of Mexico. Atlantis is a 3-dimensional, spatially explicit marine and coastal modeling framework that incorporates multiple submodels integrating biophysical, chemical, ecological, and fisheries dynamics. We found that biomass, trophic niche width, and predation mortality exerted by mesopelagic predators showed small but varied responses across different contributions of mesopelagics to predator fish diet under oil impacts. We observed shifts in the diet of pelagic predators with increasing availability of mesopelagic fish prey, suggesting that pelagic fish predator populations are more vulnerable to oil exposure if they are tightly coupled to the mesopelagic food web. These results suggest that when measured at the population level, oil-spill impacts may be harder to detect due to the response of individual fish species.},

  abstract = {Chemosynthetic bivalves from deep-sea hydrothermal vents exploit the energy derived from chemical compounds, such as methane, sulfide or hydrogen, using symbiotic bacteria that are able to fix inorganic carbon. Available chemical resources in their habitat vary widely at various scales, from the vent fields scale to the micro-habitat scale. Parallel to this environmental heterogeneity, Bathymodiolus species are considered to be flexible in their energy acquisition pathways. The goal of this study was to determine whether the isotopic compositions archived in the shells of hydrothermal vent mussels could trace chemical energy sources and their variability over spatial and temporal scales. Two different species (B. azoricus and B. thermophilus) inhabiting three vent fields with contrasted geochemical features on the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR; Rainbow and Menez Gwen) and the East Pacific Rise (EPR; 9\textdegree 47'N), were considered for carbon isotopes and growth rate variation along the shell length. The study revealed that 13C fractionation between shells and seawater is higher than expected from calcite-bicarbonate equilibrium fractionation, suggesting a significant influence of the chemosynthetic pathway on the shell composition. Furthermore, significant differences in {$\delta$}13Cshell fractionation with respect to seawater are observed between sites and habitats of the two MAR vent fields, suggesting that different chemosynthetic pathway (e.g. methanotrophic and thiotrophic) could lead to variable enrichments of the shell in 13C. Mussels supposed to rely more largely on methanotrophy (at Rainbow where free sulfide is unavailable) display a lower {$\delta$}13Cshell values than mussels relying also on sulfide-oxidizing symbiosis (at Menez Gwen). Variability in {$\delta$}13Cshell between habitats, or between individuals within the same assemblage, could thus reflect differences in the symbiosis activity at a micro-habitat scale. These isotopic signatures could provide useful information on the relationships between micro-habitat properties, symbiont activity and shell mineralization.},

Stable isotope values in animal tissues and diets have been evaluated using Bayesian mixing models to provide dietary estimates of consumers in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Fatty acids have primarily been used to examine diets of marine species. Using muscle and adipose tissue, we combined the two biomarkers in a Bayesian mixing model to generate quantitative diet estimates for gray wolves (Canis lupus, n = 78) in the southern Northwest Territories, Canada. Simulation experiments showed that the combined dataset led to more accurate and precise diet estimates than stable isotopes alone. Overall, bison (Bison bison athabascae) dominated the winter diet (63\textendash 96\%) of wolves. In one region where bison were not readily available, wolf diet was more variable, with substantial contributions from boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and beaver (Castor canadensis). Surprisingly, fish also comprised 5\textendash 26\% of wolf diet in this region. Wolves likely scavenged on scraps left behind by commercial ice fishing operations on Great Slave Lake. Our investigation underlines the power of combining these two major analytical tools to investigate diet in an elusive and opportunistic predator.},

This study aims to determine the importance of vertically migrating species in the neuston of oceanic waters across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and to ascertain the influence of environmental variables on their distribution patterns. Neustonic fish assemblages were primarily controlled by light. They were dominated by late-larvae and juveniles of Exocoetidae, Hemiramphidae and Scomberesocidae during the day. At night, the vertical migration of mesopelagic species changed the dominance pattern in favour of Myctophidae and Scomberesocidae. The neustonic families' distribution was primarily related to sea surface temperatures, whereas environmental variables at deeper layers were related to mesopelagic migrating families. Canonical correspondence analysis showed a low but statistically significant contribution of several environmental variables to myctophid species composition (10\%), with minimum oxygen concentrations ranking first in variance explanation followed by maximum fluorescence, sea surface temperature and 400-m temperature. Spatial autocorrelation also explained 17\% of the variance, indicating the influence of other factors such as historical, demographic and dispersal constraints. The low number of myctophid species in the North Pacific Equatorial Countercurrent appears to be related to the low oxygen concentrations observed in this province.},

This research addresses the estimation of the trophic position and diet of myctophids using stable isotope analyses. Fishes were collected across the central Atlantic, from a very productive zone influenced by the Mauritanian upwelling to the western oligotrophic equatorial waters. The survey also encompassed a zone of low oxygen concentration in the mesopelagic layers. Determinations of d13C and d15N values were made on the 20 most frequent and abundant myctophids, from small-sized species (e.g. Notolychnus valdivae) to larger ones (e.g. Myctophum punctatum). Isotope analyses on the seston and several plankton groups were also performed to assess the influence of zonal differences in trophic position (TP) calculations, and to use as food sources in diet estimations. Myctophids displayed a narrow range of trophic positions, being greater than 2 and less than 4, except for N. valdiviae (TP {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.7). Comparisons of diets estimated through an isotopic mixing model differentiated the smallest species, with a strong seston signature (Diogenichthys atlanticus and N. valdiviae), from the Diaphus species of medium sizes, (D. brachycephalus, D. holti, and D. rafinesquii), which feed on prey of higher TP values.},

  abstract = {The vertical distributions of early developmental stages of oceanic fishes were investigated across the tropical and equatorial Atlantic, from oligotrophic waters close to the Brazilian coast to more productive waters close to the Mauritanian Upwelling Region. Stratification of the water column was observed throughout the study region. Fishes were caught with a MOCNESS-1 net with mouth area of 1 m2 at 11 stations. Each station was sampled both during the day and at night within a single 24-h period. The investigation covered both larvae and transforming stages from the surface to 800 m depth. Distribution patterns were analysed, and weighted mean depths for the larvae and transforming stages of each species were calculated for day and night conditions. Fortyseven different species were found. The highest number of species occurred in the three stations south of Cape Verde Islands, characterized by a mixture of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). There was a marked drop in species richness in the three stations closer to the African upwelling, dominated by ENACW. The highest abundances occurred in the families Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae, Gonostomatidae and Phosichthyidae. Day and night vertical distributions of larvae and transforming stages showed contrasting patterns, both in the depths of the main concentration layers in the water column, and in the diel migration patterns (where these were observed). Larvae generally showed a preference for the upper mixed layer (ca. 0\textendash 50 m) and upper thermocline (ca. 50\textendash 100 m), except for sternoptychids, which were also abundant in the lower thermocline layer (100\textendash 200 m) and even extended into the mesopelagic zone (down to 500 m). Transforming stages showed a more widespread distribution, with main concentrations in the mesopelagic zone (200\textendash 800 m). Larvae showed peak concentrations in the more illuminated and zooplankton-rich upper mixed layers during the day and a wider distribution through the upper 100 m during the night. For most species, transforming stages were concentrated in the mesopelagic layers both day and night, although in some species (Diaphus cf. vanhoeffeni and Vinciguerria nimbaria), the transforming stages displayed vertical migration into the upper 100 m at night, in a manner similar to their adult stages.},

Bathymodiolus mussels recently discovered on African cold seeps strangely resemble Gulf of Mexico and Barbados seep species. This raises intriguing questions regarding their taxonomic relationships and their dispersal capabilities across the Atlantic equatorial belt. The morphological study of the shell and soft parts of mussels from either sites of the Atlantic shows that they form two distinct groups: the Bathymodiolus boomerang group (also including Bathymodiolus heckerae and a species from Africa), and the Bathymodiolus childressi group (also including Bathymodiolus mauritanicus and one species from Barbados). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from the nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) confirmed morphological analyses and the existence of two amphi-Atlantic complexes of species. Both ITS2 and COI phylogenies indicate almost no difference between the two eastern Atlantic seep mussels (Bathymodiolus sp. A and B. mauritanicus) and their western Atlantic counterparts (B. boomerang and Bathymodiolus sp. B; Barbados Prism cold seeps). In the B. boomerang complex, B. heckerae seems to differ from the Barbados and the African species, whereas these latter two are not distinguishable. In the B. childressi complex, relationships are less clear and do not support the description of new species from the Barbados. Past and present-day connections across the Atlantic are discussed in the light of both larval dispersal capabilities of the mussels and the equatorial Atlantic circulation to appreciate whether these species could represent true amphi-Atlantic species.

  abstract = {Three sectors of the south Barbados prism between 1000 and 2000 m depth were explored by the French submersible Nautile. Chemosynthesis-based benthic communities were discovered on several structures affected by diapirism, including mud volcanoes, domes and an anticlinal ridge. The communities are associated with the expulsion of methane-rich fluids which is a wide-spread process in the area. These communities are dominated by large bivalves and vestimentiferans which harbour chemoautotrophic symbiotic bacteria. The symbiotic bivalves include two species of Mytilidae and one of Vesicomyidae, with dominance of a methanotrophic mussel. Cartography of the benthic communities, interpretation of thermal measurements and observation of sedimentary patterns have been used to define the life habits of each of the three species of symbiotic bivalves. Each species has a characteristic preference for different conditions of edaphic and fluid flow: the dominant methanotrophic mussel appears to require high velocity vents and hard substratum. The vesicomyids and the other species of mussel are able to take up sulfide from the sediments, and so are associated with low seepages, but also require soft sediment. The three bivalve species are assumed successively to colonize the top of a diapiric ridge, in a succession related to the temporal evolution of fluid flow and sedimentation. The composition of the bivalve assemblages, their densities and biomasses all differ between the several mud volcanoes and domes studied, and these parameters are thought to be related to the spatial and temporal variations of fluid expulsion through the structures, and the lithification processes linked to fluid expulsion. One very active dome is at present colonized by an exceptionally large and dense population of the methanotrophic mussel. In contrast, communities in another area, on the domes and volcanoes that are currently inactive, were colonized by only a few living vesicomyids and mussels, both associated with sulfur-oxydizing bacteria, and there were numerous empty shells. The densities and biomasses of symbiotic bivalves were far greater in the area studied than in a deeper mud volcano field on the same prism that had been studied previously. This is consistent with a report that methane production is greater in the southern region of this accretionary prism than in the northern. Numerous non- symbiotic organisms were observed in and around the areas of the seeps, some are endemic to the seep communities, including some gastropods and shrimps, others are either colonists or vagrants from the surrounding deep-sea floor. Filter feeders were very abundant, and some of these, like the serpulids and large sponges, may also be dependent on the chemosynthetic production. Faunistic composition of both symbiotic and non- symbiotic taxa, of the assemblages around these cold seeps, is closely related to that reported for communities living on hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico.}

  abstract = {We present new high-resolution bathymetry and backscatter data acquired in 2006 with the ROV Victor 6000 over the Lucky Strike hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As long-term monitoring of the Lucky Strike area (MoMAR project) is being implemented, these new high-resolution data offer an unprecedented view of the distribution of hydrothermal edifices, eruptive facies, and small-scale tectonic features in the Lucky Strike vent field. We show that vents located in the NW and NE correspond with wide expanses of lumpy seafloor which we interpret as primarily made of broken chimneys and sulfide edifices. They are found above scarps with relief {$>$} 50 m or on associated mass wasting deposits. By contrast, the SE and SW vents correspond with small expanses of lumpy seafloor and are located near smaller scarps which we interpret as more recent faults. Hydrothermal edifices in the SW venting area appear very recent, postdating the emplacement and faulting of the most recent lava. We propose that this difference in the age of hydrothermal edifices does not mean that hydrothermal venting itself is more recent in the southern part of the Lucky Strike field because preexisting sulfide deposits there may have been buried by recent volcanic deposits. Instead, the older edifices in the northern part of the hydrothermal field may have been allowed more time to grow because they are set above the level of recent lava flows. The formation of a lava lake is the most recent eruptive event detected at Lucky Strike. Lava drainback is evidenced by benches and lava pillars, suggesting a close connection with an underlying magma reservoir, which probably corresponds to the melt body imaged by Singh et al. (2006). We have found no evidence that this lake was active for months to decades, as lava lakes at terrestrial volcanoes. It may instead have formed as a lava pond, with successive lava flows covering the eruptive vents, as proposed for similar features at the EPR. The horizontal surface of the lake is deformed only near its southwestern shore, along a NNE-trending set of faults and fissures, which appear to control the distribution of hydrothermal chimneys.},

  abstract = {The spatio-temporal dynamics of benthic and bentho-pelagic assemblages of megafauna from the middle slope of the Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea) were studied. Nineteen bottom trawls were performed to collect megafauna on 5 cruises between February 2007 and February 2008. Samples were obtained from three depth strata, including a submarine canyon. Simultaneously, environmental variables were recorded and three levels of bottom-boundary layer macrofauna (infauna, suprabenthos and zooplankton), potential prey of megafauna, were sampled. Fish and decapod assemblages were explored individually. Depth was the main factor structuring megafaunal assemblages, with larger organisms usually observed at greater depths (based on mean individual weight). Nevertheless, in April, coinciding with the reproductive period of the dominant species, larger fish and decapods were observed inside the submarine canyon rather than at greater depths. Assemblages inside and outside the submarine canyons differed in species abundance and biomass, rather than in species composition; larger densities of endobenthic species were found inside the canyon. Also, higher abundance and biomass of megafauna were recorded inside the canyon on all cruises, generally linked to higher prey availability there. A seasonal trend related to size was also observed, associated with the stratification D ( Tsurface-bottom water{$\frac{1}{4}$} 8.3770.33 1C for summer\textendash autumn) versus homogeneity D ( Tsurface-bottom water{$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.097 1.76 1C for winter\textendash spring) of the water column. Larger amounts of smaller species feeding at lower trophic levels were found in periods of homogeneity, while assemblages during periods of stratification were characterised by larger species feeding at higher trophic levels. Environmental variables most strongly explaining changes in megafaunal assemblages (from Spearman rank correlation and generalised linear models) were temperature (T) and salinity (S) close to the sea bottom, river discharges and turbidity above the sea bottom. Also, micronekton biomass explained changes in fish assemblages, while Polychaeta biomass and surface primary production were explanatory for decapods. All these variables directly or indirectly affect availability of trophic resources at bathyal depths. T and S are intrinsically related to depth, and are the variables to which organisms may be actually responding. Prey biomass plays an important role in the bathymetric and the topographic distribution of megafauna. T and S are also linked to the stratification or homogeneity of water masses. Peaks of surface primary production (SPP) in February and maximum river discharge in April corresponded to a maximum in megafaunal biomass in summer after ca. 3\textendash 5 months. High river discharges, channelled to bathyal depths through submarine canyons, were related to increases in water turbidity, associated with resuspension of organic matter (food for low trophic levels). On the other hand, low turbidity coincided with minimum river discharges, favouring deposition of organic matter in the sediments. Peaks in abundance and biomass of megafauna were observed after peaks in key prey (zooplankton, micronekton and benthic infauna) with a lag of ca. 2 months. Diversity of megafaunal assemblages was coupled to food availability.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Biochemical markers developed initially for food-web studies of terrestrial and shallow-water environments have only recently been applied to deep-sea ecosystems (i.e., in the early 2000s). For the first time since their implementation, this review took a close look at the existing literature in the field of deep-sea trophic ecology to synthesize current knowledge. Furthermore, it provided an opportunity for a preliminary analysis of global geographic (i.e., latitudinal, along a depth gradient) trends in the isotopic ({$\delta$}15N, {$\delta$}13C) and fatty acid composition of deep-sea macro- and megafauna from heterotrophic systems. Results revealed significant relationships along the latitudinal and bathymetric gradients. Deep-sea animals sampled at temperate and polar latitudes displayed lower isotopic ratios and greater proportions of essential {$\omega$}3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) than did tropical counterparts. Furthermore, {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C ratios as well as proportions of arachidonic acid increased with increasing depth. Since similar latitudinal trends in the isotopic and fatty acid composition were found in surface water phytoplankton and particulate organic matter, these results highlight the link across latitudes between surface primary production and deep-water communities. Because global climate change may affect quantity and quality (e.g., levels of essential {$\omega$}3 PUFAs) of surface primary productivity, and by extension those of its downward flux, the dietary intake of deep-sea organisms may likely be altered. In addition, because essential {$\omega$}3 PUFAs play a major role in the response to temperature variations, climate change may interfere with the ability of deep-sea species to cope with potential temperature shifts. Importantly, methodological disparities were highlighted that prevented in-depth analyses, indicating that further studies should be conducted using standardized methods in order to generate more reliable global predictions.},

  abstract = {The study of vertical migrations in aquatic organisms has a long and colourful history, much of it to do with the effects of changing sampling technology on our understanding of the phenomenon. However, the overwhelming majority of such studies carried out today still depend on detecting differences in vertical distribution profiles during some course of time, or acoustic echoes of migrating bands of organisms. These can not distinguish migratory activity of individual organisms, but can only assess net results of mass transfers of populations, which may integrate many individual migrations. This is an important distinction, for without knowing the actual movements of individuals it seems unlikely that we will be able to understand their causes, nor the effects of vertical migrations on the environment or on the migrators themselves. This review examines evidence for individual vertical movements gathered from ` tracers ', mainly gut contents, and reviews the evidence for the hypothesis that such movements are in fact driven by hunger and satiation. The more recently appreciated vertical migrations of phytoplankters and their similarities in form and driving forces to those of zooplankton and nekton are also discussed. Finally, the role of vertical migrators in vertical fluxes of materials is discussed, along with the consequences of satiation-driven descent for such estimates.},

Water mass properties as well as mixing processes studied through optimum multiparameter (OMP) analysis provided information on the physical seascape. This study reports for the first time a bathypelagic deep scattering layer that was detected in autumn (1300\textendash 1500 m) and winter (800\textendash 1200 m) and did not present a daily migration pattern. Migrant deep scattering layers and non-migrant layers, stronger at 18 and 38 kHz respectively, are two separate entities with distinct spatial and seasonal dynamics. Migrant layers vary in number and intensity with primary production while the main non-migrant layer (400\textendash 800 m depth) is constant in intensity throughout the year. Non-migrant layers seem to locate at horizontal water mass boundaries with increased stratification.},

Light avoidance was only discernible at 18 kHz within the main NMDSL when this layer was intense, suggesting that migrants are barely seen at 38 kHz when other resonant scatterers occupy these depths. These results highlight the importance of employing the 18 kHz frequency from a vessel borne echosounder or lowered echosounders attached to a probe to study gas-bearing migrants.},

  abstract = {Seabird distributions and the associated seasonal variations remain challenging to investigate, especially in oceanic areas. Recent advances in telemetry have provided considerable information on seabird ecology, but still exclude small species, non-breeding birds and individuals from inaccessible colonies from any scientific survey. To overcome this issue and investigate seabird distribution and abundance in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA), large-scale aerial surveys were conducted in winter 2011-12 and summer 2012 over a 375,000 km2 area encompassing the English Channel (EC) and the Bay of Biscay (BoB). Seabird sightings, from 15 taxonomic groups, added up to 17,506 and 8263 sightings in winter and summer respectively, along 66,307 km. Using geostatistical methods, density maps were provided for both seasons. Abundance was estimated by strip transect sampling. Most taxa showed marked seasonal variations in their density and distribution. The highest densities were recorded during winter for most groups except shearwaters, storm-petrels, terns and large-sized gulls. Subsequently, the abundance in winter nearly reached one million individuals and was 2.5 times larger than in summer. The continental shelf and the slope in the BoB and the EC were identified as key areas for seabird conservation, especially during winter, as birds from northern Europe migrate southward after breeding. This large-scale study provided a synoptic view of the seabird community in the ENA, over two contrasting seasons. Our results highlight that oceanic areas harbour an abundant avifauna. Since most of the existing marine protected areas are restricted to the coastal fringe, the importance of oceanic areas in winter should be considered in future conservation plans. Our work will provide a baseline for the monitoring of seabird distribution at sea, and could inform the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

  abstract = {The tectonically-controlled margins off Southern Italy are carved by several shelf-indenting submarine canyons that are periodically flushed by sedimentary gravity flows. In this study, the distribution of benthic and demersal megafauna within the thalweg of some of these canyons (i.e. the Gioia-Petrace and Caulonia Marina canyons in the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Calabrian margins, respectively, and the Sant'Agata, San Gregorio, Tremestieri and Messina canyons in the Messina Strait) was studied using Remotely Operated Vehicle video transects. The relationships between fauna distribution and environmental conditions (i.e. seafloor type, depth, slope, aspect and canyon system) extracted from video footage and bathymetric data were assessed to identify the main physical drivers influencing the megafaunal assemblages within active submarine canyons. These latter have their heads in shallow water, so representing highly dynamic environments affected by present-day sediment transport. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis allowed to distinguish seven different assemblages occurring in the study areas. PERMANOVA analysis showed significant differences among species groups associated to different seafloor types, depth ranges and canyon systems. Distance-based linear modeling (DistLM) identified the canyon system as the main factor explaining the variability of the megafaunal assemblages across the study areas. In the Gioia and Petrace canyons, both characterized by homogenous fine-grained sediment, the assemblages were mainly dominated by Polychaeta Sabellidae and Ceriantharia. The almost total absence of sessile fauna at the canyons' head was interpreted as an effect of a strong physical disturbance due to the impact of sedimentary flows. In the canyons of the Messina Strait, the presence of more varied seafloor encompassing fine and coarse sediment along with an higher spatial heterogeneity of physical disturbance, determined more diversified faunal assemblages, featuring species associated with hard and soft substrates. More in detail, in the Sant'Agata, San Gregorio and Messina canyons the colonization of cobbles and boulders by slow-growing species vulnerable to physical disturbance such as the gorgonians Acanthogorgia hirsuta and Swiftia dubia was recorded. For the Tremestieri canyons a stronger impact by sedimentary flows was reflected both by a very high abundance of land-based litter and the lowest values of species richness. Interactions between megafauna and marine litter, whose widespread occurrence was recorded on the floor of all these canyons, have been also presented and discussed. Although in several cases litter caused entanglement of benthic species, the anthropogenic debris was also used as growing substrate or shelter by some invertebrates and fishes, suggesting complex fauna-litter interactions that should be better explored. Overall, the large variability in morphology and seafloor characteristics across the studied canyons is reflected on the variability of megafauna assemblages, suggesting a strong influence of the physical conditions specific of each canyon in controlling fauna distribution.},

  abstract = {Sympatric harbour (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) are increasingly considered potential competitors, especially since recent local declines in harbour seal numbers while grey seal numbers remained stable or increased at their European core distributions. A better understanding of the interactions between these species is critical for conservation efforts. This study aimed to identify the trophic niche overlap between harbour and grey seals at the southern limit of their European range, in the Baie de Somme (BDS, Eastern English Channel, France), where numbers of resident harbour seals and visiting grey seals are increasing exponentially. Dietary overlap was identified from scat contents using hierarchical clustering. Isotopic niche overlap was quantified using {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N isotopic values from whiskers of 18 individuals, by estimating isotopic standard ellipses with a novel hierarchical model developed in a Bayesian framework to consider both intraindividual variability and interindividual variability. Foraging areas of these individuals were identified from telemetry data. The three independent approaches provided converging results, revealing a high trophic niche overlap due to consumption of benthic flatfish. Two diet clusters were dominated by either small or large benthic flatfish; these comprised 85.5\% [CI95\%: 80.3\%\textendash\-90.2\%] of harbour seal scats and 46.8\% [35.1\%\textendash\-58.4\%] of grey seal scats. The narrower isotopic niche of harbour seals was nested within that of grey seals (58.2\% [22.7\%\textendash\-100\%] overlap). Grey seals with isotopic values similar to harbour seals foraged in coastal waters close to the BDS alike harbour seals did, suggesting the niche overlap may be due to individual grey seal strategies. Our findings therefore provide the basis for potential competition between both species (foraging on benthic flatfish close to the BDS). We suggest that a continued increase in seal numbers and/or a decrease in flatfish supply in this area could cause/amplify competitive interactions and have deleterious effects on harbour seal colonies.},

  abstract = {The assessment and comparison of food webs across various hydrothermal vent sites can enhance our understanding of ecological processes involved in the structure and function of biodiversity. The Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike and Rainbow vent fields are located on the Azores triple junction of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These fields have distinct depths (from 850 to 2320~m) and geological contexts (basaltic and ultramafic), but share similar faunal assemblages defined by the presence of foundation species that include Bathymodiolus azoricus, alvinocarid shrimp and gastropods. We compared the food webs of 13 faunal assemblages at these three sites using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses (SIA). Results showed that photosynthesis-derived organic matter is a negligible basal source for vent food webs, at all depths. The contribution of methanotrophy versus autotrophy based on Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) or reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles varied between and within vent fields according to the concentrations of reduced compounds (e.g. CH4, H2S). Species that were common to vent fields showed high trophic flexibility, suggesting weak trophic links to the metabolism of chemosynthetic primary producers. At the community level, a comparison of SIA-derived metrics between mussel assemblages from two vent fields (Menez Gwen \& Lucky Strike) showed that the functional structure of food webs was highly similar in terms of basal niche diversification, functional specialization and redundancy. Coupling SIA to functional trait approaches included more variability within the analyses, but the functional structures were still highly comparable. These results suggest that despite variable environmental conditions (physico-chemical factors and basal sources) and faunal community structure, functional complexity remained relatively constant among mussel assemblages. This functional similarity may be favoured by the propensity of species to adapt to fluid variations and practise trophic flexibility. Furthermore, the different pools of species at vent fields may play similar functions in the community such as the change in composition does not affect the overall functional structure. Finally, the absence of a relationship between the functional structure and taxonomic diversity as well as the high overlap between species' isotopic niches within communities indicates that co-occuring species may have redundant functions. Therefore, the addition of species within in a functional group does not necessarily lead to more complexity. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of food webs within chemosynthetic communities and emphasizes the need to better characterize species' ecological niches and biotic interactions.},

Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout,               Zoarces viviparus               , a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.},

  abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climateinduced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperaturedependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO2 (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

However, it is unclear how the oceanographic changes associated with strong El Ni\~no events affected the midwater organisms on which D. gigas feed, limiting our ability to assess the relative importance of temperature and food availability in the phenotypic response of D. gigas to environmental variability. We quantified the diet of D. gigas in the GOC before, during, and following the past three El Ni\~no events and found that although its diet varied little across a large range of body sizes (8\textendash 85 cm), significant and predictable diet variability was observed with respect to sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration. Consumption of large numbers of relatively small, high calorie prey in both relatively cool (anchovies) and relatively warm, productive conditions (myctophids) is likely necessary to support growth to large body sizes before maturation. When warm, unproductive conditions prevailed in the GOC, only small squid were present and had diets dominated by euphausiids and pteropods, prey with relatively low caloric value. Using a time series of diet data, this work provides unique insights into the response of a midwater forage community to oceanographic variability and the effects of environmental variability on the trophic ecology of an oceanic predator.},

  abstract = {The stable isotopes of nitrogen (?15N) and carbon (?13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how ?15N and ?13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of ?15N is 3.4\textperthousand{} (1 SD ϭ 1\textperthousand ) and of ?13C is 0.4\textperthousand{} (1 SD ϭ 1.3\textperthousand ), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of ?15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of ?13C when ?13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

The contents of 380 non-empty stomachs were analysed from specimens caught with longlines during scientific cruises carried out from 2001 to 2003. Diet data were processed by occurrence, mean proportion by number, wet weight, and mean proportion by reconstituted weight. Crustaceans, dominated by the swimming crab Charybdis smithii and the stomatopod Natosquilla investigatoris, were the major food source of lancetfish. Cannibalism was also significant for that species. Yellowfin tunas preyed upon a large diversity of mesopelagic fishes, crustaceans (C. smithii and crab larvae) and cephalopods (the ommastrephid Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis). Mesopelagic fishes (Cubiceps pauciradiatus and Diretmoides parini) and cephalopods (mainly S. oualaniensis) were the main prey of swordfish. Diet overlap between swordfish and yellowfin tuna was evidenced by high Morisita\textendash Horn index. But the feeding habits of these three predators differed by foraging depth and prey size, with swordfish feeding at deeper depths and on larger prey than the more epipelagic lancetfish and yellowfin tuna. Using these three predators as biological samplers, the present study provides novel data on micronekton fauna that is poorly documented in the western Indian Ocean: 67 families and 84 species of prey were recovered in the stomach contents, and our results indicate the presence of large resources of pelagic crustaceans that play a primary role in the epipelagic food chain.},

  abstract = {Three hundred species of zooplankton have been identified in the Bay of Biscay, among which 10\% are copepods. Diversity and variability of taxa, with time and space at all scales, are remarkable. Biology, ecology and biomass of species belonging to mesozooplankton are best known, whereas studies on micro- and macrozooplankton species are scarce. Field estimates of growth and secondary production, even of the most frequent and abundant species, are also scarce. Mesozooplankton carbon biomass represents 4-20\% of total particulate organic carbon (POC) and ranges between 2 and 300 mgC.m-3. Highest values of zooplankton standing stock are generally found either in spring, summer or autumn, depending on stations located in mixed and frontal waters, or in the vicinity of estuaries. Values for density and biomass of zooplankton are not linearly related in time and vary by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in relation to hydrological conditions and seasons. Based on literature and chlorophyll regimes, it appears that zooplankton in the Bay of Biscay is generally food limited; so that, zooplankton (i.e. copepods) may not reach optimum growth and production rates, except in specific water conditions enhancing primary production or high standing stock ({$\geq$} 2 \textmu g Chlo a. l-1) of phytoplankton. Growth of anchovy larvae and reproduction of adults are critical phases in the life cycle of anchovy, which both rely on different and specific food categories. Matching between anchovy spawning, nursery sites and areas with high standing stock and productivity of zooplankton have never been evaluated in the Bay of Biscay.},

  abstract = {The mesopelagic community is important for downward oceanic carbon transportation and is a potential food source for humans. Estimates of global mesopelagic fish biomass vary substantially (between 1 and 20 Gt). Here, we develop a global mesopelagic fish biomass model using daytime 38 kHz acoustic backscatter from deep scattering layers. Model backscatter arises predominantly from fish and siphonophores but the relative proportions of siphonophores and fish, and several of the parameters in the model, are uncertain. We use simulations to estimate biomass and the variance of biomass determined across three different scenarios; S1, where all fish have gas-filled swimbladders, and S2 and S3, where a proportion of fish do not. Our estimates of biomass ranged from 1.8 to 16 Gt (25\textendash 75\% quartile ranges), and median values of S1 to S3 were 3.8, 4.6, and 8.3 Gt, respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that for any given quantity of fish backscatter, the fish swimbladder volume, its size distribution and its aspect ratio are the parameters that cause most variation (i.e. lead to greatest uncertainty) in the biomass estimate. Determination of these parameters should be prioritized in future studies, as should determining the proportion of backscatter due to siphonophores.},

Crustaceans were also important in the diet (12\%N, 2\%M), but given their small size, it is questionable whether they were primary or secondary prey. Foraging on cephalopods seemingly took place only occasionally: they represented 2\%N and 39\%M of the total diet, but were absent from the fresh fraction of stomach contents. Prey sizes ranged from 6 to 228 mm. Juvenile albacore consume either epipelagic prey by day, or vertically migrating mesopelagic species that reach the surface layer by night.},

The previous idea of low diversity stems from lack of appreciation of the fact that apparent diversity is dependent on sample size, especially in small samples. Diversity in the deep-sea is much greater han in equivalent shallow marine environments from temperate latitudes and is of the some magnitude as in the shallow marine tropics.

Minimum size at maturity was far smaller than reported from previous investigations in the same region. Fecundity was size-dependent and total egg numbers were higher than reported from other investigations ofM. muelIeri world wide, while the number of maturing eggs was far lower than observed in the same region earlier. Food concentration in the fjord was an order of magnitude lower than previous early summer observations, and several factors indicated that feeding opportunities may have been low for a long period. Daily feeding rate (g prey g-1 fish) decreased with increasing fish size. These observations fit well with a model of maximizing fitness by means of a flexible size at maturity. Minimum age at maturity seems to be achieved at the expense of fecundity. M. muelleri was concentrated in a 20 to 30 m deep sound scattering layer (SSL). The SSL stayed close to the surface during the night and at 100 to 180 m during the daytime. The vertical position of the SSL varied instantaneously with changes in surface light intensity, remaining at 10-3 to 10-4 gmol m-1 s-I at the top of the SSL. Stomach fullness was highest during the night; feeding intensity seems to have been peaked at dusk. Cladocerans were the main prey ranked by number, copepods by biomass. Intake of large copepods increased with fish size.},

Three characteristic zones were identified along the cross-section of the sagittae (larval, metamorphic and juvenile-adult zones). Assuming growth rings as daily increments, the age of the analysed individuals (from 3.5 to 64 mm standard length [SL]) would range from 7 to 332 days. The relationship between the number of increments and the fish SL was fitted to a von Bertalanffy growth model (SL=70.5899\texttimes (1\textendash exp(\textendash 0.0501(t+2.6705))). The growth pattern of C. maderensis in the western Mediterranean Sea was similar to that reported for this species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Though from a body size of 40-45 mm SL, growth rates declined more slowly in individuals from the western Mediterranean Sea, growth differences between these individuals and those from the northeast Atlantic Ocean were not statistically significant. This study provides new insights into the age and growth patterns of one of the most abundant mesopelagic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea that have clear implications for the study and management of marine ecosystems.},

Information on their feeding habits is still sparse, representing a key area of un\- certainty in efforts to understand and model Southern Ocean food web dynamics. We used visual assessment of stomach contents to characterise the diets of three myctophids (Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri, Krefftichthys anderssoni) and one bathylagid (Bathylagus antarcticus) over the southern extension of the Kerguelen Plateau (`southern Kerguelen Axis'), a highly productive area of both biological and economic importance in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Diets of all four species were dominated by euphausiids, amphipods, co\- pepods and fish. Bathylagus antarcticus also preyed upon a high proportion of soft-bodied organisms. There was strong evidence for dietary variability both within and between species, and this variability was driven by lat\- itudinal variation in zooplankton assemblages. Size-based shifts in diet were apparent, with larger individuals of myctophid and bathylagid species consuming larger prey. Linear mixed effects models also demonstrated that the weight of prey consumed increased in relation to predator weight. Dietary information presented here advances our understanding of the mesopelagic components of Southern Ocean food webs, which will improve the development of food web models for the region.},

This goal can be achieved in part by acquiring more detailed food web information and evaluating the processes that shape food web structure and dynamics. Our main objective was to identify largescale patterns in the organization of pelagic food webs that can be linked to a wasp-waist (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle Channel (BC), the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (CA) and the oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean.},

Mean d13C values of these predators were similar among species, ranging from \textendash 18.17 to \textendash 18.99 \&, suggesting that all species are supported by a similar carbon source. This finding was supported by mixingmodel analysis; all of these deep-living predators received the majority ({$>$}73\%) of their carbon from epipelagic food resources. Mean d15N values of the predators ranged from 9.18 to 11.13 \&, resulting in trophic position estimates between the third and fourth trophic level, although significant shifts in d15N with increasing body size suggest that some of these species undergo ontogenetic shifts in trophic position. Bayesian standard ellipses, used to estimate isotopic niche areas, differed in size among species, with those occupying the highest relative trophic positions possessing the largest isotopic niches. These results, which provide the first trophic descriptions using dietary tracers for several of these species, offer insight into the trophic structure of deep-sea ecosystems and will help inform the construction of ecosystem-based models.},

Benthic communities associated with reduced, sulphidic microhabitats such as sediments and carbonate crusts were sampled by remotely operated vehicles during two cruises in 2006 (BIONIL) and 2007 (MEDECO). Environmental conditions and biological factors including family-level faunal composition, density and diversity were measured at local and regional scales. Significant differences were detected at different spatial scales: (1) the fauna of reduced habitats differed substantially in activity, diversity and biomass from the non-seep environment at similar water depth, (2) cold seep microhabitats showed differences in community structure and composition related to substratum type as well as to the intensity and location of fluid emissions.}

However, few studies have quantified individual specialization within and between sympatric species that are functionally similar but have different foraging modes. We assessed the relationship between individual specialization, isotopic niche metrics and foraging behaviour of two marine predators with contrasting foraging modes: pelagic foraging female South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) and benthic foraging female southern sea lions (Otaria byronia). Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen was conducted along the length of adult female vibrissae to determine isotopic niche metrics and the degree of individual specialization. Vibrissae integrated time ranged between 1.1 and 5.5 years, depending on vibrissae length. We found limited overlap in dietary niche-space. Broader population niche sizes were associated with higher degrees of individual specialization, while narrower population niches with lower degrees of individual specialization. The degree of individual specialization was influenced by pelagic and benthic foraging modes. Specifically, South American fur seals, foraging in dynamic pelagic environments with abundant but similar prey, comprised specialist populations composed of generalist individuals. In contrast, benthic southern sea lions foraging in habitats with diverse but less abundant prey had more generalist populations composed of highly specialized individuals. We hypothesize that differences in specialization within and between populations were related to prey availability and habitat differences. Our study supports growing body of literature highlighting that individual specialization is a critical factor in shaping the ecological niche of higher marine predators.},

However, the food web interactions that occur in the mesopelagic zone are difficult to measure and so, despite their crucial importance to global elemental cycles, are not very well known. Recent developments in technology and new approaches have advanced the study of the variability in and controls upon the distribution and diversity of organisms in the mesopelagic zone, including the roles of respiration, recycling, and repackaging of particulate and dissolved organic material. However, there are remarkably few syntheses of the ecology and biogeochemistry of the microbes and metazoa that permanently reside or habitually visit this `twilight zone'. Without this synthesis, it is difficult to assess the impact of ongoing changes in ocean hydrography and chemistry, due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, on the biological carbon pump. This paper reviews what is known about the distribution of microbes and metazoa in the mesopelagic zone in relation to their activity and impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, gaps in our knowledge are identified and suggestions made for priority research programmes that will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on carbon sequestration.},

This vast realm contains what may be the greatest number of animal species, the greatest biomass, and the greatest number of individual organisms in the living world. Humans have explored the deep ocean for about 150 years, and most of what is known is based on studies of the deep seafloor. In contrast, the water column above the deep seabed comprises more than 90\% of the living space, yet less than 1\% of this biome has been explored. The deep pelagic biota is the largest and least-known major faunal group on Earth despite its obvious importance at the global scale. Pelagic species represent an incomparable reservoir of biodiversity. Although we have yet to discover and describe the majority of these species, the threats to their continued existence are numerous and growing. Conserving deep pelagic biodiversity is a problem of global proportions that has never been addressed comprehensively. The potential effects of these threats include the extensive restructuring of entire ecosystems, changes in the geographical ranges of many species, large-scale elimination of taxa, and a decline in biodiversity at all scales. This review provides an initial framework of threat assessment for confronting the challenge of conserving deep pelagic biodiversity; and it outlines the need for baseline surveys and protected areas as preliminary policy goals.},

However, Antarctic species make these migrations in the absence of two of the three selective advantages generally ascribed to this behaviour. Because the water column is nearly isothermal, there is no metabolic bonus to be gained from thermal differences in habitat depth. Likewise, because their prey do not perform significant vertical migrations, the fish migrations act to diminish rather than enhance their feeding opportunities. For Antarctic midwater fish, the sole advantage of these migrations appears to be the avoidance of visually-cued predators in the upper part of the water column. An evaluation of the relative importance of the three selective factors supports the suggestion that predator avoidance may also be the principal driver of diel vertical migrations for midwater fish at lower latitudes.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}15N) and body size were used to describe the size-based trophic structure of a deep-sea ecosystem, the Avil\'es submarine Canyon (Cantabrian Sea, Southern Bay of Biscay). We analyzed {$\delta$}15N of specimens collected on a seasonal basis (March 2012, October 2012, and May 2013), from a variety of zones (benthic, pelagic), taxa (from zooplankton through invertebrates and fishes to giant squids and cetaceans), or depths (from surface to 4700 m) that spanned nine orders of magnitude in body mass. Our data reveal a strong linear dependence of trophic level on body size when data were considered either individually, aggregated into taxonomical categories, or binned into size classes. The three approaches render similar results that were not significantly different and yielded predator:prey body mass ratios (PPMR) of 1156:1, 3792:1 and 2718:1, respectively. Thus, our data represent unequivocal evidence of interspecific, size-based trophic structure of a whole ecosystem based on taxonomic/functional categories. We studied the variability in {$\delta$}15N not explained by body mass (W) using linear mixed modeling and found that the {$\delta$}15N vs. log10 W relationship holds for both pelagic and benthic systems, with benthic organisms isotopically enriched relative to pelagic organisms of the same size. However there is a marked seasonal variation potentially related to the recycling state of the system.},

  abstract = {Many species of micronekton perform diel vertical migrations (DVMs), which ultimately contributes to carbon export to the deep sea. However, not all micronekton species perform DVM, and the nonmigrators, which are often understudied, have different energetic requirements that might be reflected in their trophic ecology. We analyze bulk tissue and whole animal stable nitrogen isotopic compositions ({$\delta$}15N values) of micronekton species collected seasonally between 0 and 1250 m depth to explore differences in the trophic ecology of vertically migrating and nonmigrating micronekton in the central North Pacific. Nonmigrating species exhibit depth-related increases in {$\delta$}15N values mirroring their main prey, zooplankton. Higher variance in {$\delta$}15N values of bathypelagic species points to the increasing reliance of deeper dwelling micronekton on microbially reworked, very small suspended particles. Migrators have higher {$\delta$}15N values than nonmigrators inhabiting the epipelagic zone, suggesting the consumption of material during the day at depth, not only at night when they migrate closer to the surface. Migrating species also appear to eat larger prey and exhibit a higher range of variation in {$\delta$}15N values seasonally than nonmigrators, likely because of their higher energy needs. The dependence on material at depth enriched in 15N relative to surface particles is higher in migratory fish that ascend only to the lower epipelagic zone. Our results confirm that stark differences in the food habits and dietary sources of micronekton species are driven by vertical migrations.},

Although the concentration of MeHg in the water column is known to increase with depth down to a maximum found at the base of the permanent thermocline, the knowledge of the relationship between MeHg content in marine species and their depth of occurrence is limited. We analyzed total mercury (THg) and MeHg concentrations in 25 species of fish inhabiting the Avil\textasciiacute es Submarine Canyon and its adjacent shelf (Cantabrian Sea, North-East Atlantic) between 50 and 1868 m depth. THg concentrations ranged from 0.03 {$\mu$}g g- 1 in wet weight (ww) in Chauliodus sloani and 4.0 {$\mu$}g g- 1 ww in Coryphaenoides guentheri. 65\% of the species analyzed exceeded 0.5 {$\mu$}g g- 1 ww of MeHg, the maximum level for safe consumption recommended by FAO/ WHO. THg and MeHg contents in muscle tissue increased with the depth of occurrence of fish and was influenced by their habitat so that demersal species had higher THg content than pelagic species inhabiting the same depth. MeHg accounted for an average 76 {$\pm$} 3.9\% of THg (mean {$\pm$} SD), which is lower than that reported for other fish communities and can be explained by the high concentration of Hg present in sediments of the Nalo\textasciiacute n estuary, which discharges right off the Avil\textasciiacute es Canyon head. The \% of THg as MeHg was also strongly correlated with {$\delta$}15N values, confirming that MeHg can be an indicator of the trophic identity of a species within the food web.},

  abstract = {Numerous submarine canyons along the United States middle Atlantic continental margin support enhanced productivity, diverse and unique habitats, active fisheries, and are vulnerable to various anthropogenic disturbances. During two cruises (15 Aug\textendash 2 Oct 2012 and 30 Apr\textendash 27 May 2013), Baltimore and Norfolk canyons and nearby areas (including two cold seeps) were intensively surveyed to determine demersal fish distributions and habitat associations. Overall, 34 ROV dives (234\textendash 1612 m) resulted in 295 h of bottom video observations and numerous collections. These data were supplemented by 40, 30min bottom trawl samples. Fish observations were assigned to five general habitat designations: 1) sandmud (flat), 2) sloping sand-mud with burrows, 3) low profile gravel, rock, boulder, 4) high profile, canyon walls, rocks or ridges, and 5) seep-mixed hard and soft substrata, the later subdivided into seven habitats based on amounts of dead mussel and rock cover. The influence of corals, sponges and live mussels (seeps only) on fish distributions was also investigated. Both canyon areas supported abundant and diverse fish communities and exhibited a wide range of habitats, including extensive areas of deep-sea corals and sponges and two nearby methane seeps (380\textendash 430 m, 1455\textendash 1610 m). All methods combined yielded a total of 123 species of fishes, 12 of which are either new records for this region or have new range data. Depth was a major factor that separated the fish faunas into two zones with a boundary around 1400 m. Fishes defining the deeper zone included Lycodes sp., Dicrolene introniger, Gaidropsaurus ensis, Hydrolagus affinis, Antimora rostrata, and Aldrovandia sp. Fishes in the deep zone did not exhibit strong habitat affinities, despite the presence of a quite rugged, extensive methane seep. We propose that habitat specificity decreases with increasing depth. Fishes in the shallower zone, characterized by Laemonema sp., Phycis chesteri, Nezumia bairdii, Brosme brosme, and Helicolenus dactylopterus, exhibited a variety of habitat use patterns. In general, fish assemblages in the soft substrata areas (dominated by P. chesteri, N. bairdii, Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, Lophius americanus, Merluccius albidus) were different from those in more complex habitats (dominated by Laemonema spp., Hoplostethus spp., B. brosme, Benthocometes robustus, L. americanus, Dysommina rugosa). Although, when present, the dense coral and sponge cover did not statistically affect general fish assemblage patterns in hard bottom habitats, these sessile organisms markedly increased habitat complexity, and some fish species exhibited close association with them. Fish species compositions in the two canyons were not substantially different from the surrounding slopes. However, the diversity of habitats within both the canyons and seeps exerted an important influence on assemblage structure. At least for some species (e.g., B. brosme) canyon and seep environments may be a refuge from intensive bottom fishing activities. We frequently observed evidence of commercial and recreational fishing activity (lost gear on bottom and fishing boats in the area) throughout the canyons and some resulting habitat damage. Conservation measures for the unique and more vulnerable areas (seep and coral habitats) have recently been approved.},

  abstract = {Midwater fish faunas over three cold seep habitats 41000 m (AC601, GC852, AT340) and over a cold-water coral bank (VK826, o1000 m) in the north-central Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are described and compared. Day and night discrete-depth sampling was accomplished at each study site, 9\textendash 29 August 2007, using an opening\textendash closing Tucker trawl towed at depth for 30 min. The 159 Tucker trawl stations yielded 9802 individuals and at least 126 species (30 families) of juvenile and adult midwater fishes. Myctophidae (38 species, 28\% of the total catch), Stomiidae (17 species, 1.4\%), Gonostomatidae (12 species, 56\%), Sternoptychidae (10 species, 6\%), and Phosichthyidae (5 species, 6\%) dominated catches at all sites. Thirty-one species (8 families) comprised about 90\% of the overall abundance of fishes across the four sites. Despite the wide separation of study sites and some differences in physical oceanography, geographic and temporal patterns in mesopelagic fish assemblages were not evident (ANOSIM, Global R{$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.20, p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.1\%, pairwise R values o0.3). However, station groupings were related mostly to similarities in sampled depths (SIMPROF, po1.5\%). Upper water-column station groups (o400 m) were typified by Lepidophanes guentheri, Diaphus dumerilii, Vinciguerria nimbaria, Vinciguerria poweriae, Valenciennellus tripunctulatus, Argyropelecus aculeatus, Notolychnus valdiviae, Benthosema suborbitale, Gonostoma elongatum, and Hygophum taaningi. Deeper station groups (mean depth{$\frac{1}{4}$}609 m) were typified by Cyclothone alba, Cyclothone acclinidens, Cyclothone braueri, Cyclothone obscura, Cyclothone pallida, Cyclothone pseudopallida, V. tripunctulatus, and Hygophum benoiti. Depth, diel, and size distributions were also analyzed for abundant species. For example, Cyclothone spp., abundant at all sites except VK826, usually occurred in deeper waters (4130 m), especially during daylight hours (4335 m). Most Cyclothone individuals were captured at night at GC852, whereas catches were more evenly distributed across times at AT340 and VK826. Cyclothone spp. individuals occurred in the deeper parts of the sampled depth range at AT340 and VK826 at all times compared with GC852, where they appeared to undergo a diel migration. The two most abundant Cyclothone spp., C. pallida and C. pseudopallida, had the broadest depth ranges (150\textendash 1377 m) and exhibited a trend for larger specimens to occur deeper at GC852. Most V. tripunctulatus were captured at night and tended to have larger mean sizes in deeper waters. This species did not exhibit strong diel patterns of vertical distribution. Shallower depths were occupied at night by some individuals at all sites, but most individuals remained somewhat deeper at night at VK826 (350\textendash 450 m at night and 200\textendash 350 m by day) and AT340 (200\textendash 600 m at night and 300\textendash 500 m by day) compared with GC852 (150\textendash 450 m at night and 750 and 1000 m by day). Nearly all Vinciguerria poweriae were caught at night, and no clear trend of size with depth was apparent. This species occupied a wider depth range at night, with most in the upper 200 m. Most myctophids, the strongest diel migrators, were captured at night at the offshore stations. The dominant myctophid, N. valdiviae, was most abundant at GC852 (550\textendash 1050 m by day and 50\textendash 750 m at night), but diel movement was more distinct at AT340 (o200 m at night and 350\textendash 500 m by day). No size-related trends with depth were apparent at any site for N. valdiviae, and size distributions were similar among sites.},

The geographic changes were simulated by manipulating the spatial distributions of the demersal species (observed during bottom trawl surveys). Hence, the spatial distributions of the latter being used as input data on which the manipulations were done. Additionally, other aspects of the indicators affecting the responses to the geographic changes were also tested, (1) homogeneous increase in biomass throughout the patch and (2) different sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Ontogenetic dietary shifts (ODSs), the changes in diet utilisation occurring over the life span of an individual consumer, are widespread in the animal kingdom. Understanding ODSs provides fundamental insights into the biological and ecological processes that function at the individual, population and community levels, and is critical for the development and testing of hypotheses around key concepts in trophic theory on model organisms. Here, we synthesise historic and contemporary research on ODSs in fishes, and identify where further research is required. Numerous biotic and abiotic factors can directly or indirectly influence ODSs, but the most influential of these may vary spatially, temporally and interspecifically. Within the constraints imposed by prey availability, we identified competition and predation risk as the major drivers of ODSs in fishes. These drivers do not directly affect the trophic ontogeny of fishes, but may have an indirect effect on diet trajectories through ontogenetic changes in habitat use and concomitant changes in prey availability. The synthesis provides compelling evidence that ODSs can have profound ecological consequences for fish by, for example, enhancing individual growth and lifetime reproductive output or reducing the risk of mortality. ODSs may also influence food-web dynamics and facilitate the coexistence of sympatric species through resource partitioning, but we currently lack a holistic understanding of the consequences of ODSs for population, community and ecosystem processes and functioning. Studies attempting to address these knowledge gaps have largely focused on theoretical approaches, but empirical research under natural conditions, including phylogenetic and evolutionary considerations, is required to test the concepts. Research focusing on inter-individual variation in ontogenetic trajectories has also been limited, with the complex relationships between individual behaviour and environmental heterogeneity representing a particularly promising area for future research.},

Stable isotope analyses identified that black scabbardfish feeds on species with epipelagic and benthopelagic affinities. For the west of British Isles, the {$\delta$}N values were significantly different between seasons suggesting a change in the diet throughout the year. Black scabbardfish have higher {$\delta$}N and {$\delta$}C values compared with other co-occurring benthopelagic feeders and lower nitrogen values than the true benthic predators and/ or scavengers. Comparison with stable isotope analysis in samples from Madeira indicated that black scabbardfish feed at a similar trophic level and has the same trophic niche width in both areas, assuming similar baseline isotope compositions. The diet in the northern area comprised fish (68\% N), crustaceans (22\% N) and cephalopods (15\% N) with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) constituting 40\% of the prey. Seasonal shift in diet was observed, with a predominance of blue whiting (70\%) in the first quarter of the year, shifting to a more diverse diet in the remainder of the year. These results indicate that the diet of black scabbardfish is closely linked with the seasonal migration of blue whiting and that they likely select prey in proportion to availability. This study demonstrates that the combined used of both methods can elucidate the trophic ecology of black scabbardfish, in situations where conventional methods alone provide insufficient data.},

  abstract = {Water samples were collected around the communities of a hydrothermal mussel, Bathymodiolus sp., in the Lucky Strike (1700 m depth) and Menez Gwen (850 m depth) areas, Mid Atlantic Ridge, and analysed for chemical constituents. The environment surrounding the organisms consists in sea water (88 to 100\%) mixed with hydrothermal fluid with pH between 6.2 and 8, Sigma S (H2S + HS-) concentrations from 0 to 62 mu mol l(-1). High dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations suggest a highly productive ecosystem. Production of ammonium and DOG, consumption of nitrate and sulfide in the vicinity of the organisms are among the environmental changes found in relation with local biological activity. Concentrations of Cu and Pb were high, implying that the organisms need to have efficient strategies of adaptation. An empirical distinction between the extreme sizes of the mussels ({$>$} 6 cm and {$<$} 3 cm) reveals that the size distribution of the communities is related to the presence of different environments: the large size classes are present closer to the fluid exits, with higher Sigma S concentrations, than the small size classes. This could indicate differences in the growth rate related to the availability of the energy sources, competition for energy and space, and/or different settlement periods.}

  abstract = {Knowledge on quantitative faunal distribution patterns of hydrothermal communities in slow-spreading vent fields is particularly scarce, despite the importance of these ridges in the global mid-ocean system. This study assessed the composition, abundance and diversity of 12 benthic faunal assemblages from various locations on the Eiffel Tower edifice (Lucky Strike vent field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and investigated the role of key environmental conditions (temperature, total dissolved iron (TdFe), sulfide (TdS), copper (TdCu) and pH) on the distribution of macro- and meiofaunal species at small spatial scales ({$<$} 1 m). There were differences in macro- and meiofaunal community structure between the different sampling locations, separating the hydrothermal community of the Eiffel Tower edifice into three types of microhabitats: (1) cold microhabitats characterized by low temperatures ({$<$}6 \textdegree C), high TdCu (up to 2.4{$\pm$}1.37 \textmu mol l-1), high pH (up to 7.34{$\pm$}0.13) but low TdS concentrations ({$<$}6.98{$\pm$}5.01 \textmu mol l-1); (2) warm microhabitats characterized by warmer temperatures ({$>$}6 \textdegree C), low pH ({$<$}6.5) and high TdS/TdFe concentrations ({$>$}12.8 \textmu mol l-1/{$>$}1.1 \textmu mol l-1 respectively); and (3) a third microhabitat characterized by intermediate abiotic conditions. Environmental conditions showed more variation in the warm microhabitats than in the cold microhabitats. In terms of fauna, the warm microhabitats had lower macro- and meiofaunal densities, and lower richness and Shannon diversity than the cold microhabitats. Six macrofaunal species (Branchipolynoe seepensis, Amathys lutzi, Bathymodiolus azoricus, Lepetodrilus fucensis, Protolira valvatoides and Chorocaris chacei) and three meiofaunal taxa (Paracanthonchus, Cephalochaetosoma and Microlaimus) were identified as being significant indicator species/taxa of particular microhabitats. Our results also highlight very specific niche separation for copepod juveniles among the different hydrothermal microhabitats. Some sampling units showed unique faunal composition and increased beta diversity on the Eiffel Tower edifice. Contrary to what was expected, the highest beta diversity was not associated with a particular microhabitat type, but rather with location on the central part of the edifice where other structuring factors may predominate.},

  abstract = {This study defines the composition and biomass characteristics of 5 of 6 previously described faunal assemblages that form a mosaic community on hydrothermal sulfide edifices of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (northeast Pacific). Quantitative samples of each assemblage were acquired during 'ROPOS' Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) dive programs in 1994 and 1996. Total abundance, and species richness, as well as wet and dry weights, were calculated for each assemblage, and sampled surface area was measured directly or from scaled images of sample scars. These data were used to compare species composition, richness and biomass of the distinct assemblages and to estimate total biomass of a sulfide edifice. In addition to major compositional differences, we observed an increase in density, biomass and species richness along a proposed successional sequence from the Paralvinella sulfincola (annelid polychaete) assemblage (Assemblage I) to the low-now Ridgeia piscesae (vestimentifera) community (Assemblage V-LF). Biomass (dry weight without vestimentiferan tubes) of the different sampled assemblages ranged from 0.011 kg m(-2) for Assemblage I to 4.68 kg m(-2) for Assemblage V-LF and 2.33 kg m(-2) for the rarer high-flow Ridgeia piscesae community (V-HF). Resulting quantitative information was used to refine a previous model of community succession. Comparisons with other marine ecosystems showed that the biomass of these and other hydrothermal assemblages dominated by symbiont-bearing organisms (vestimentifera, bivalvia) is similar to those found in the most productive photosynthetically based assemblages. Tubeworm growth and sulfide accretion greatly increase total surface area available to vent organisms, and may attenuate competition for space. The 3-dimensional habitat formed by Ridgeia piscesae tubes may influence species distribution and enhance species richness. The tube worm assemblages comprise the major and probably the most stable component of total edifice biomass. At one site, over a 4 yr period, there was substantial environmental change and major shifts in coverage by other assemblages but relatively little change in total coverage by R. piscesae. As a result total edifice biomass (219 to 251 kg dry weight) varied by only 16\% over 1 to 3 yr intervals. Considerable quantitative ecological information can be derived from analyses of submersible-collected imagery, with sampling serving primarily as a ground truthing tool. Limitations of sampling and surface area determinations are considered.},

Video imagery was acquired during a total of 5 manned submersible and ROV (remotely-operated vehicle) dive programs between 1991 and 1995. The structure was systematically mapped for each year of the study and a series of analytical tools was developed to quantify changes in biological and geological features and observable flow patterns. Results show: (1) heterogeneous faunal distribution characterized by decimeter-scale patchiness and general absence of vertical gradients; (2) apparent Links between community distribution, and environmental features such as fluid now patterns, substratum and temperature/chemical conditions; (3) a significant influence of perturbations on community dynamics; (4) absence of directional biological succession at the time scale examined (years). Overall, these observations strongly suggest that many hydrothermal community changes are initiated by gradual and abrupt flow modifications. Results are compiled in a dynamic succession model for sulfide edifices where community transitions are driven by flow variations, and by biological processes operating at sub-annual time scales. We conclude by stressing the need for extended monitoring of short-term dynamics in order to understand the relationship between hydrothermal communities and their environment.},

A total of 551 transforming stage larvae were collected at the 19 sampling stations. Except for the Diaphus species and Notolychnus valdiviae, all of the transforming stage larvae (including genera Benthosema, Bolinichthys, Centrobranchus, Ceratoscopelus, Diogenichthys, Hygophum, Lampanyctus, Lobianchia, Myctophum, Symbolophorus, and Triphoturus) were collected in the lower mesopelagic zone from 600- to 900-m depth during both day and night, showing no diel vertical migration (DVM). On the contrary, the Diaphus species and N. valdiviae larvae undergo DVM during the transforming stage, occurring below 200-m layer during the daytime and migrating up to the upper 150-m layer at night, i.e., they show earlier adaptation to juvenile\textendash adult behaviors. Most myctophid fish larvae are known to undertake substantial ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) from the epipelagic to mesopelagic zones during their early life stage. Although considerable sampling effort was carried out in this study, transforming larvae, except for the above two migratory ones, were not collected in the epipelagic and upper mesopelagic zones, strongly suggesting that their sinking speed would be high. It would be advantageous for survival to spend their highly vulnerable transforming stage in the lower mesopelagic zone, where predation pressures are lower and physical conditions are more stable than in the upper layers.},

Dense distributions ({$>$}105 ind. km\textendash 2) of B. pterotum were observed mainly in the area south of Cheju Island in all seasons, where a persistent cyclonic eddy occurs. The distribution pattern indicated the presence of an independent population completing their life cycle in the area south of Cheju Island. Daytime habitat depth of B. pterotum (mainly 40 to 90 m depth) was a markedly shallower depth than previous reports for adult fishes for the family Myctophidae. The mechanism of population maintenance of this mesopelagic species in such a shallow area was hypothesized to be related to the presence of highly turbid waters in the benthopelagic layer, which produces dim light conditions during the daytime. The biomass of B. pterotum in the area south of Cheju Island was estimated to range from 3900 to 38 400 t.},

We explored the spatial dynamics of DSLs off the Bahamas in shaping oligotrophic ecosystems. We compared 2 areas known to be important foraging habitats for a deep-diving predator, Blainville's beaked whales: the Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO), an oceanographically isolated habitat, and the waters off Abaco Island, an oceanographically connected habitat. Using ship-based multifrequency echosounders and direct net sampling, we identified common layer structures characterized by diffuse, broad layers ({$>$}100 m in thickness) observed across the study areas. Within those diffuse layers, we occasionally observed distinctively bounded intense layers (\textasciitilde 20 m in thickness) located at the upper edges of the DSLs. We found that spatial variability of layer structures shaped the Bahamian ecosystem. By comparing common layer types across the sampling locations, 2 potential mechanisms were identified. The area off Abaco Island was characterized by diffuse layers comprised of larger animals with greater migration distance and biomass than the habitat in TOTO, suggesting that Abaco may transfer more energy between energy-rich surface waters and the deep sea. Within TOTO, habitat most frequently used by beaked whales was characterized by the highest occurrence of intense layers dominated by thinner layers, suggesting such fine-scale structures may increase foraging efficiency by layer predators. Spatial variability of the DSL structures reveals the dynamics of the Bahamian mesopelagic ecosystem, potentially driving the beaked whales through bottom-up control of their prey.},

Annual production estimates are often calculated using empirical models and based on data collected during a single period of the year. Yet, many ecosystems show seasonal variations. Although ignoring seasonality may lead to biased and inaccurate estimates of annual secondary production, it has never been tested at the community level. Using time series of macrobenthic data collected seasonally at three temperate marine coastal soft-bottom sites, we assessed seasonal variations in biomass of macrobenthic invertebrates at both population and community levels. We then investigated how these seasonal variations affect the accuracy of annual benthic production when assessed using an empirical model and data from a single sampling event. Significant and consistent seasonal variations in biomass at the three study sites were highlighted. Macrobenthic biomass was significantly lower in late winter and higher in summer/early fall for 18 of the 30 populations analyzed and for all three communities studied. Seasonality led to inaccurate and often biased estimates of annual secondary production at the community level when based on data from a single sampling event. Bias varied by site and sampling period, but reached \$ 50\% if biomass was sampled at its annual minimum or maximum. Since monthly sampling is rarely possible, we suggest that ecologists account for uncertainty in annual production estimates caused by seasonality.},

  abstract = {The rates of metabolism in animals vary tremendously throughout the biosphere. The origins of this variation are a matter of active debate with some scientists highlighting the importance of anatomical or environmental constraints, while others emphasize the diversity of ecological roles that organisms play and the associated energy demands. Here, we analyse metabolic rates in diverse marine taxa, with special emphasis on patterns of metabolic rate across a depth gradient, in an effort to understand the extent and underlying causes of variation. The conclusion from this analysis is that low rates of metabolism, in the deep sea and elsewhere, do not result from resource (e.g. food or oxygen) limitation or from temperature or pressure constraint. While metabolic rates do decline strongly with depth in several important animal groups, for others metabolism in abyssal species proceeds as fast as in ecologically similar shallow-water species at equivalent temperatures. Rather, high metabolic demand follows strong selection for locomotory capacity among visual predators inhabiting well-lit oceanic waters. Relaxation of this selection where visual predation is limited provides an opportunity for reduced energy expenditure. Large-scale metabolic variation in the ocean results from interspecific differences in ecological energy demand.},

No fish which is rich in both triglycerides and wax esters was observed in the present study. The triglyceride-rich and wax ester-rich groups were found in the western subarctic Pacific, i.e., the Oyashio species, while the phospholipid-rich group with low-lipid content was found in the tropical species, i.e., the Equatori al and Central Water species. Three species, Stenobrachius leucopsarus, Lampanyctus regalis and Stenobrachius nannochir, contained wax esters with 30 to 44 carbon chain lengths as the major lipids, always accounting for more than 90\% of total lipids. The main alcohol moieties of wax esters were 16:0, 20:1 and 22:1, while oleic acid (18:1n-9) and other monoenoic acids were predominantly fatty acids.

Based on the percent index of relative importance (\%IRI), the data suggest dietary specialisation in some species, which may permit resource partitioning. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarity (60\% threshold) separated the myctophid community into distinct feeding guilds. One group (G. braueri and E. antarctica) fed principally on Themisto gaudichaudii, another (P. choriodon and G. fraseri) primarily on copepods (Metridia spp. and Rhincalanus gigas), and a third group (G. nicholsi and P. bolini) consumed copepods and euphausids (mostly Metridia spp. and Euphausia frigida). The diets of E. carlsbergi and K. anderssoni differed from the other species, with E. carlsbergi being the only species that consumed salps. There was a general switch in diet from copepods to euphausiids and amphipods as the myctophid predator size increased. Dietary specialisation is likely the result of a combination of predator size, gape size, filtering capacity of the gill rakers and the vertical distribution of predators and prey. Antarctic krill were only consumed by the larger myctophids, which represented a numerically minor part of the myctophid community, supporting the concept that myctophids can provide a krill-independent link between secondary production and higher trophic levels. However, the northern Scotia Sea is dominated by adult krill, which are only suitable as prey for larger fish. In the northern Scotia Sea, myctophid predation had a very small impact on copepod production but a higher impact on macrozooplankton, with a best-estimate of 4\% of the daily production of Themisto gaudichaudii and 6\% of that of Euphausia superba being consumed.},

  abstract = {To date, several cold-seep areas which fuel chemosynthesis-based benthic communities have been explored, mainly by deployment of manned submersibles. They are located in the Atlantic and in the Eastern and Western Pacific oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea, in depths ranging between 400 and 6000 m in different geological contexts in passive and active margins. Our study is based on a review of the existent literature on 24 deep cold seeps. The geographic distribution of seeps, the variations of origin and composition of fluids, and rates of fluid flow are presented as they are important factors which explain the spatial heterogeneity and the biomass of biological communities. Methane-rich fluid of thermogenic and/or biogenic origin is the principal source of energy for high-productive communities; however, production of sulphide by sulphate reduction in the sediment also has a major role. The dominant seep species are large bivalves belonging to the families Vesicomyidae or Mytilidae. Other symbiont-containing species occur belonging to Solemyidae, Thyasiridae, Lucinidae bivalves, Pogonophora worms, Cladorhizidae and Hymedesmiidae sponges. Most of the symbiont-containing cold-seep species are new to science. Different symbiont-containing species rely on sulphide or methane oxidation, or both, via chemoautotrophic endosymbiotic bacteria. A total of 211 species, from which 64 are symbiont-containing species, have been inventoried. Patterns in biodiversity and biogeography are proposed. A large majority of the species are endemic to a seep area and the symbiont-containing species are mainly endemic to the cold-seep ecosystem. A comparison of species found in other deep chemosynthesis-based ecosystems, hydrothermal vents, whale carcass and shipwreck reduced habitats, reveals from the existing data, that only 13 species, of which five are symbiont-containing species occur, at both seeps and hydrothermal vents. The species richness of cold-seep communities decreases with depth. High diversity compared to that on hydrothermal vent sites is found at several seeps. This map be explained by the duration of fluid flow, the sediment substrate which may favour long-term conditions with accumulation of sulphide and the evolution of cold seeps.

Many mesopelagic organisms perform light-dependent diel vertical migration. It has been hypothesised that extreme light regimes encountered at high latitudes may disturb these migration patterns and thereby limit the northern expansion of mesopelagic fauna into the Arctic. Using hydroacoustic data collected during 4 surveys conducted in the open Norwegian Sea during the summer season, we evaluated if the key features of mesopelagic fauna reported worldwide (high density and diel vertical migration) are also observed in the high latitudes of the Northeast Atlantic. The results confirm that the high-latitude Northeast Atlantic hosts a high density of mesopelagic fauna which performs daily migration patterns similar to those reported in other regions. They also support the limiting effect of photoperiod on its potential biomass. These results stress the need for thorough studies on the abundance, biodiversity and trophic ecology of the mesopelagic fauna in this region.},

  abstract = {Micronekton of the mesopelagic zone (200 m\textendash 1000 m depth) play a central role in most aspects of global marine ecology linking epipelagic and deep scattering layers as planktivores, carnivores and principal prey to both shallow diving and deep living apex predators. Yet, despite this critical role and conspicuous presence, little is known regarding most aspects of mesopelagic community ecology, including habitat associations at sub-basin spatial scales. Here we address several aspects of these data deficiencies in the eastern Bering Sea mesope\- lagic \textendash{} a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem home to multiple protected predator species and large commercial fisheries. Through 41 midwater trawls conducted at 250 m, 500 m and 1000 m depths during May of 1999 and 2000, and a series of generalized linear models and cluster analyses, we describe the influence of remotely sensed oceanographic habitat variables on the diel distribution, relative abundance and community composition of 30 species of mesopelagic fish and squid in 3 contrasting study areas. We then project the total energy available to predators at depth and across the eastern Bering Sea Basin based on the identified habitat constraints. Fishes from the families Bathylagidae and Myctophidae, and squids from the Gonatidae dominated the 72 species catch biomass (n = 225,000, 2,100 kg). The six most abundant species were equally divided between each of the three dominant families and are also the most highly represented mesopelagic species in eastern Bering Sea pelagic predator diets. Their association with surface habitat variables describe a complex and multifaceted relationship between physical/biological predictors and the total mesopelagic energy field during the spring bloom period in this ecosystem. Leuroglossus schmidti, Bathylagus pacificus, Stenobrachius leucopsaurus, S. nannochir, Gonatopsis borealis and Eogonatus tinro contrast in the suite of physical and biological variables that they respond to, and also in the character of their response. Although L. schmidti is of moderate caloric value, it expressed the greatest overall energy signature at all depths due to its overwhelming biomass, and response to the presence of specific, variable habitat conditions across extensive portions of the study area. Interannual variability in habitat variables forecasted a pronounced redistribution of dominant species and thereby total mesopelagic energy content \textendash{} providing a potential mechanism for shifts in central-place predator habitat use, energy expenditure, and diet. The known relevance of mesopelagic species as prey and the energetic potential for apex predators foraging in the Basin illustrates a cautionary narrative regarding unregulated harvest of biota from this poorly understood and critically important oceanic zone.},

Data were collected in the Bari Canyon and in an adjacent area on the continental slope during an experimental longline survey carried out in June 2015. A total of 19 fish species were collected (16 inside and 13 outside the canyon). Differences between the sites were evaluated by means of a set of univariate and multivariate methods (analysis of variance, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, non-metric multidimensional scaling). The abundance and biomass of the whole catch were significantly greater inside than outside the canyon. The most abundant species were the shark Galeus melastomus and the teleost fishes Conger conger, Helicolenus dactylopterus, Merluccius merluccius, Pagellus bogaraveo and Phycis blennoides. All these species were found to be more abundant in the canyon than in the adjacent area. However, a significantly greater abundance inside the canyon than outside was detected for C. conger, while P. blennoides showed both significantly greater abundance and biomass in the canyon than outside. P. bogaraveo was exclusively caught inside the canyon. C. conger and P. blennoides exhibited significant differences in their sizes between the canyon and the adjacent area: a greater number of both smaller and larger individuals were found in the canyon than on the open slope. Mature females and males were mostly observed in the canyon in all the most abundant species, with the exception of P. blennoides due to its autumn-winter spawning. The present study corroborates the role of the Bari Canyon as a refuge area and an Essential Fish Habitat for fish species exploited in the neighbouring fishing grounds, highlighting the need for conservation measures.},

Traditional trawling for assessing fish stocks is impossible under the thick pack ice, and coherent hydroacoustic surveys are unachievable due to ice-breaking noise. Consequently, nothing is known about the existence of any pelagic fish stocks in the CAO, although juveniles of Boreogadus saida richly occur at the surface associated with the sea ice and iceassociated Arctogadus glacialis has been reported as well. We here present a first indication of a possible meso\- pelagic fish stock in the CAO. We had the opportunity to analyse a geophysical hydroacoustic data set with 13 time windows of usable acoustic data over a transect from 84.4 {$\smwhtcircle$}N in the Nansen Basin, across the North Pole (90.0 {$\smwhtcircle$}N), to 82.4 {$\smwhtcircle$}N in the Canada Basin. We discovered a deep scattering layer (DSL), suggesting the presence of zooplankton and fish, at 300\textendash 600 m of depth in the Atlantic water layer of the CAO. Maximum possible fish abundance and biomass was very low; values of ca. 2,000 individuals km- 2 and ca. 50 kg km- 2 were calculated for the DSL in the North-Pole area according to a model assuming that all acoustic backscatter represents 15-cm long B. saida and/or A. glacialis. The true abundance and biomass of fish is even lower than this, but cannot be quantified from this dataset due to possible backscatter originating from pneumatophores of physonect sipho\- nophores that are known to occur in the area. Further studies on the DSL of the CAO should include sampling and identification of the backscattering organisms. From our study we can conclude that if the central Arctic DSL contains fish, their biomass is currently too low for any sustainable fishery.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that drive prey selection is a major challenge in foraging ecology. Most studies of foraging strategies have focused on behavioural costs, and have generally failed to recognize that differences in the quality of prey may be as important to predators as the costs of acquisition. Here, we tested whether there is a relationship between the quality of diets (kJ?g21) consumed by cetaceans in the North Atlantic and their metabolic costs of living as estimated by indicators of muscle performance (mitochondrial density, n = 60, and lipid content, n = 37). We found that the cost of living of 11 cetacean species is tightly coupled with the quality of prey they consume. This relationship between diet quality and cost of living appears to be independent of phylogeny and body size, and runs counter to predictions that stem from the well-known scaling relationships between mass and metabolic rates. Our finding suggests that the quality of prey rather than the sheer quantity of food is a major determinant of foraging strategies employed by predators to meet their specific energy requirements. This predator-specific dependence on food quality appears to reflect the evolution of ecological strategies at a species level, and has implications for risk assessment associated with the consequences of changing the quality and quantities of prey available to top predators in marine ecosystems.},

Knowledge of prey quality appears to be crucial in ecosystem modelling and management. The aim here was to provide baseline data of forage species quality in the Bay of Biscay. Proximate composition (water, ash, protein, and lipid) and energy content have been determined to assess the quality of 78 species, including jellyfish, crustaceans, cephalopods, cartilaginous fish, and bony fish. Results show broad variations between species, with energy densities ranging from 2 to 10 kJ g21. Lipids are the most structuring component and largely determined prey quality, and prey species are not necessarily interchangeable for the fulfilment of a predator's energy and food requirements. In ecosystem models, therefore, multispecies compartments of forage organisms would ideally be constituted using prey species of equivalent quality and hence of equivalent benefit to top predators.},

Our oceans\textemdash the largest underexplored component of the Earth system\textemdash are potentially home for a large number of new resources, which can directly impact upon food security and the wellbeing of humanity. However, the extraction of these resources has repercussions for biodiversity and the oceans ability to sequester green house gases and thereby climate. In the search for ``new resources'' to unlock the economic potential of the global oceans, recent observations have identified a large unexploited biomass of mesopelagic fish living in the deep ocean. This biomass has recently been estimated to be 10 billion metric tons, 10 times larger than previous estimates however the real biomass is still in question. If we are able to exploit this community at sustainable levels without impacting upon biodiversity and compromising the oceans' ability to sequester carbon, we can produce more food and potentially many new nutraceutical products. However, to meet the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations, we need to guarantee a sustainable exploitation of these resources. To do so requires a holistic assessment of the community and an understanding of the mechanisms controlling this biomass, its role in the preservation of biodiversity and its influence on climate as well as management tools able to weigh the costs and benefits of exploitation of this community.},

Here we investigated whether such behaviour is consistent under varying light conditions and over an extended period. We analysed acoustic observations of ontogenetically varying scattering layers (SLs) versus surface irradiance from selected days during a 9 mo period (January to September 2008). On the majority of days, a strong correlation (r2 {$>$} 0.90) between upper SL depth and surface irradiance was observed. The SLs of M. muelleri suggest that this species has a restricted range of preferred light intensities. This tendency was found regardless of season and migration phase, i.e. during dawn descent, dusk ascent and daytime. The irradiance estimated at the top of the upper SL for consecutive days, regardless of migration phase, varied on average by less than 1 order of magnitude, while the average monthly estimates for the descent, ascent and daytime periods varied from 0.004 to 0.39 \textmu E m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1, 0.08 to 2.35 \textmu E m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1 and 0.02 to 0.68 \textmu E m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1, respectively. During their ascent, fish experienced up to 9 times higher light intensities than during the descent. Our study suggests that the vertical migration of M. muelleri emerges because of a vertical habitat selection that can be characterised by the preference of a restricted range of light intensities and that these intensities may be state and age dependent.},

The data revealed known patterns as normal diel vertical migration (DVM), midnight sinking between dusk and dawn, and periods without migrations, as well as novel behaviours consisting of early morning ascents, reverse diel vertical migrations, and interrupted ascents in the evening. During the first autumn of the study, adult fish modified their normal DVM behaviour by suspending their migration in the evening, yet ascending toward the surface in the later part of the night to reach upper layers during dawn. This behaviour was not observed during the second autumn of the study. By mid- to end of November (1st autumn), adult fish had suspended the nocturnal ascent entirely, and in the subsequent period until the end of January, a fraction of the population rather performed limited reverse migrations, slightly shifting their vertical distribution upwards during the first part of the day. From January to March 2008, fish interrupted their evening ascent at apparently random intervals and returned to deeper waters, instead of completing a full ascent to the surface. Our study underlines the value of long-term recordings, with the results suggesting that M. muelleri has the capability of changing its behaviour in response to ontogeny and internal state (satiation and hunger) as well as to external stimuli.},

  abstract = {The pelagic food web of the Scotia Sea was studied by analysing natural abundances of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes of primary producers and pelagic consumers, sampled from the seasonal ice edge in the south to the Antarctic Polar Front in the north. The analysis covered, within a single mid-summer period, particulate organic matter (POM) and 38 taxa, ranging from suspension feeding copepods and salps to omnivorous euphausiids, pelagic fish and higher, land-based predators including fur seals, penguins and flying birds. Spatial variation in d15N of POM correlated well with nutrient availability and primary productivity. Latitudinal differences in d13C of POM were closely linked to variations in temperature, nutrients and productivity depending on the frontal region sampled. This translated to equivalent (although smaller) regional d13C differences among higher trophic levels. The trophic positions of species based on isotope values broadly agreed with previously published dietary data with three important exceptions. First, the carnivorous amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii had anomalously low d15N values. Second, Euphausia superba had d15N values that were also surprisingly low, considering the abundant literature suggesting its omnivory. Third, the copepod Rhincalanus gigas, considered a suspension feeder, had unexpectedly high d15N values rather more in keeping with omnivorous feeding. The consumer d15N values ranged from 1.2\% (min.) measured in Salpa thompsoni (designated here as trophic level (TL) 2 across all regions) to 15.2\% (max.) measured in white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis, calculated as TL5 relative to the TL2 of salps). Excluding seabirds, the resulting food chain length of 3.7 TL (above POM at TL1) was lower than in most other Southern Ocean and temperate marine pelagic ecosystems. The majority (60\%) of vertebrate predators occupied only 1\textendash 1.5 trophic levels above the herbivorous suspension feeders such as krill. This indicates the existence of the classic short food chain of POM\textendash suspension feeder\textendash vertebrate predator. However the presence of trophic levels 4 and above indicates the existence of alternative trophic pathways, for example involving myctophid fish or carrion, and that some wide-ranging predators which breed at South Georgia also feed outside the region. This conclusion is supported first by the continuum of d15N values between krill, suspension feeding copepods and myctophid fish, and secondly by higher trophic levels in several of the myctophid species in the low-krill region of the northern Scotia Sea, suggesting latitudinal differences in food web structure and food chain length.},

  abstract = {Assessing fluxes of matter and energy in food webs within and across benthic habitats is important to understand the ecological functioning in bays and estuaries, where the productivity is favoured by a wide diversity of pri\- mary producers. The temporal variability (March vs September 2019) in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of primary food sources and benthic invertebrates consumers was investigated in a large intertidal area (Western English-Channel, France). The study area is influenced by megatidal conditions and characterised by salt marshes in the sheltered part, and seasonal Ulva spp. blooms. The spatio-temporal variability in the structure of the benthic food web was analysed at the scales of both the whole bay and the different assemblages, which constitute the mosaic of habitats. Inferences on potential sources fuelling the food web were supported by spatio-temporal patterns based on covariations and stable isotope trajectory analysis. Results highlighted that phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and SOM were, most likely, the main food sources. The trophic connectivity between salt marsh and benthic habitats within the bay was limited to some macrofauna species inhabiting muddy creeks within the salt marsh. Unexpectedly, the influence of Ulva spp. blooms appeared also limited. Spatial patterns illustrates the constancy of the spatial variability in the benthic pelagic coupling, with a higher influence of microphytobenthos in the upper shore compared to low shore assemblages. This first attempt to characterize intertidal benthic food web constitutes a relevant baseline for the conservation of the bay of SaintBrieuc where a national Nature Reserve has been created in 1998 for the conservation of overwintering birds. The spatial and temporal patterns of the benthic food web observed in this study (1) confirm the importance to consider food web variability at spatial and temporal scales from sampling designs to data analysis, and (2) demonstrate the ability of the stable isotope trajectory analysis framework to highlight food web dynamics.},

This domain represents \textasciitilde 91\% of the GoM's volume and almost certainly contains the majority of its metazoan inhabitants. Ultra-deep oil spills may or may not reach the surface or the seafloor but will occur entirely within the deepwater column domain at some point and likely for the longest duration. Recent research has shown the deep-pelagic GoM to be extremely rich in biodiversity, both taxonomic and functional. Indeed, the GoM is one of the four ``hyperdiverse'' midwater ecosystems in the World Ocean. This biodiversity is functionally important. For example, well over half (58\%) of all fish species known to exist in the GoM spend all or part of their lives in the oceanic domain. Recent research has also shown the deep-pelagic GoM to be highly connected vertically, as well as horizontally (onshore-offshore). This vertical connectivity provides an increasingly valued ecosystem service in the form of atmospheric carbon sequestration via the ``biological pump.'' In this chapter, we summarize the GoM deep-pelagic nekton (fishes, macrocrustaceans, and cephalopods) that have been, and would be, affected by ultra-deep oil spills. We also discuss key aspects of distribution and behavior (e.g., vertical migration). These behaviors and distributions are key elements of ecosystem assessments before and after oil spills.},

  abstract = {The deep-sea fish Malacosteus niger belongs to a family of fishes, the dragonfishes (Order: Stomiiformes, Family: Stomiidae), that are among the top predators of the open ocean mesopelagic zone. Malacosteus typifies the morphological adaptation of this group for the taking of relatively large prey. These adaptations include huge fangs, an enormous gape, and the loss of gill rakers. Despite these adaptations, examination of specimens of this species from different ocean basins shows that zooplanktivory is a common feeding mode of the species, an extreme departure from its trophic lineage. Large calanoid copepods made up 69\textendash 83\% of prey numbers and 9\textendash 47\% of prey biomass in specimens from the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and throughout the Pacific. As M. niger feeding observations have never been reported, the rationale for this enigmatic feeding ecology must be inferred from other aspects of its ecology. As presently known, M. niger is unique among all vertebrates in the possession of both a long-wave bioluminescence system and a bacteriochlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer that allows long-wave visual sensitivity. A two-part theory is presented to explain why M. niger radically diverges from its clade and preys on food it does not appear morphologically suited to eat: (1) the combination of long-wave bioluminescence and vision systems suggests that M. niger may search small volumes for food, and thus may sustain itself energetically by snacking on small parcels of food (copepods) in between rare encounters with large prey, and (2) M. niger may gain the raw material for its long-wave visual sensitivity, and thus its feeding mode, from the consumption of copepods.},

  abstract = {The trophic ecology of the stomiid assemblage (Pisces, Stomiiformes, Stomiidae) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region with physical and biological characteristics typical of oligotrophic low-latitude regimes, was investigated. Over 1400 specimens representing 69 species and 17 genera were examined. Four patterns of feeding were evident among the abundant stomiids: (1) myctophid predation; (2) zooplankton/small micronekton predation; (3) penaeidean shrimp predation; and (4) copepod/micronekton predation. One rare species preyed on cephalopods. It was concluded that stomiids exhibited a high level of prey-selectivity, particularly considering the broad range of prey types available in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The absence of numerically dominant potential prey (e.g. Cyclothonespp., sternoptychids) in the diets of piscivorous stomiids is possibly a function of feeding periodicity coupled with stomiid vertical migration. Stomiids may feed at night in the upper 200 m on vertically migrating myctophids while disregarding co-occurring nonmigrating prey during the daytime. Integration of stomiid abundance and diet data suggests that: (1) stomiids are the dominant upper trophic-level predators of the Gulf of Mexico mesopelagial; (2) stomiids inflict the highest predation impact on myctophids in low-latitude midwater ecosystems; and (3) the historic use of predation-avoidance arguments to explain certain mesopelagic phenomena (e.g. vertical migration, ventral photophores) appears to be substantiated by estimates of stomiid predationqmpact. The stomiids may serve as key trophic mediators in the transfer of energy from the mesopelagial to the bathyand benthopelagial.},

  abstract = {A research cruise was made in the Irminger Sea west and southwest of Iceland and adjacent waters on the Icelandic vessel \'Arni Fri\dh riksson, from 03 Jun-04 Jul 2003. The main purpose was to study distribution and abundance of deepwater redfishes, Sebastes mentella et sp., other pelagic fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton and the hydrography of the area. Part of the cruise was devoted to a special study on community structure at transect over the northern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Reykjanes Ridge). In this paper, an overview is given on the composition of the pelagic fish community, both vertically and horizontally, over the northern part of the Reykjanes Ridge. In total, nine trawl hauls were made with a ``GLORIA'' midwater trawl outfitted with a small mesh size (9-mm) cod-end. Three hauls were made at three different depths west of the Ridge, three above it and three East of the Ridge. A total of 230 nautical miles separated hauls taken west of the Ridge and east of it. A minimum total of 44 species were identified from 23 families. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), pearlsides (Sternoptychidae), barracudinas (Paralepididae), dragonfishes (Stomiidae) and deep-sea smelts (Microstomatidae) dominated fish catches. Results show that the total number of fishes caught was lowest east of the Ridge, coinciding with warmer deep waters. At all positions both number of species and families increased with depth as the number of individuals decreased with depth.},

  abstract = {The assemblage structure and vertical distribution of deep-pelagic fishes relative to a mid-ocean ridge system are described from an acoustic and discrete-depth trawling survey conducted as part of the international Census of Marine Life field project MAR-ECO /http://www.mar-eco.noS. The 36-station, zig-zag survey along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR; Iceland to the Azores) covered the full depth range (0 to 43000 m), from the surface to near the bottom, using a combination of gear types to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the pelagic fauna. Abundance per volume of deep-pelagic fishes was highest in the epipelagic zone and within the benthic boundary layer (BBL; 0\textendash 200 m above the seafloor). Minimum fish abundance occurred at depths below 2300 m but above the BBL. Biomass per volume of deep-pelagic fishes over the MAR reached a maximum within the BBL, revealing a previously unknown topographic association of a bathypelagic fish assemblage with a mid-ocean ridge system. With the exception of the BBL, biomass per volume reached a water column maximum in the bathypelagic zone between 1500 and 2300 m. This stands in stark contrast to the general ``open-ocean'' paradigm that biomass decreases exponentially from the surface downwards. As much of the summit of the MAR extends into this depth layer, a likely explanation for this mid-water maximum is ridge association. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that the dominant component of deep-pelagic fish biomass over the northern MAR was a wide-ranging bathypelagic assemblage that was remarkably consistent along the length of the ridge from Iceland to the Azores. Integrating these results with those of previous studies in oceanic ecosystems, there appears to be adequate evidence to conclude that special hydrodynamic and biotic features of mid-ocean ridge systems cause changes in the ecological structure of deep-pelagic fish assemblages relative to those at the same depths over abyssal plains. Lacking terrigenous input of allochthonous organic carbon, increased demersal fish diversity and biomass over the MAR relative to the abyssal plains may be maintained by increased bathypelagic food resources. The aggregation of bathypelagic fishes with MAR topographic features was primarily a large adult phenomenon. Considering the immense areal extent of mid-ocean ridge systems globally, this strategy may have significant trophic transfer and reproductive benefits for deep-pelagic fish populations.},

  abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in the development of statistical tools to quantify trophic relationships using stable isotope ratios, including tools that address size and overlap of isotopic niches. We build upon recent progress and propose a new probabilistic method for determining niche region and pairwise niche overlap that can be extended beyond two dimensions, provides directional estimates of niche overlap, accounts for species-specific distributions in niche space, and, unlike geometric methods, produces consistent and unique bivariate projections of multivariate data. We define the niche region (NR) as a given 95\% (or user-defined a) probability region in multivariate space. Overlap is calculated as the probability that an individual from species A is found in the NR of species B. Uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework, and is the only aspect of the methodology that depends on sample size. Application is illustrated with three-dimensional stable isotope data, but practitioners could use any continuous indicator of ecological niche in any number of dimensions. We suggest that this represents an advance in our ability to quantify and compare ecological niches in a way that is more consistent with Hutchinson's concept of an ``ndimensional hypervolume.''

  abstract = {The northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), from Iceland to the Azores, ranges in depth from 800\textendash 4500 m and extends over an area of 3.7 million km2. Despite its size, few studies have described the distribution of pelagic fishes along the MAR. Recent evidence from MAR-ECO, a Census of Marine Life field project, reported increased abundance and biomass of deep-pelagic fishes below 1000 m on the ridge, which stands in stark contrast to the traditional view that abundance and biomass decline exponentially with increasing depth in `typical' open ocean ecosystems. Among the midwater fishes sampled during the MAR-ECO campaign, Bathylagus euryops (Argentiniformes: Microstomatidae) was the biomass-dominant pelagic species and ranked third in total abundance. In this paper, we characterize the distribution of B. euryops in relation to physical and biological variables along the MAR. Average catch of B. euryops over the MAR varied between 0.68 individuals/100,000 m37 0.70 individuals at the Azorean Zone and 5.82 individuals/100,000 m37 2.08 individuals at the Reykjanes Ridge. Generalized linear models applied to B. euryops catch data indicated that ridge section, depth zone, and prey abundance were important explanatory variables in structuring the distribution along the MAR. Analyses of vertical distribution patterns, relative to time of day and fish size, showed that larger fish were found deeper in the water column, likely due to an ontogenetic migration to depth. Mean fish size increased from 58.9 mm standard length in the epipelagic zone and continually increased to 155.7 mm standard length between 2300\textendash 3000 m. Due to the high abundance and biomass observed along the MAR, B. euryops appears to be an important species in the oceanic food web of the North Atlantic Ocean.},

Only a single taxon (the gastropod Pseudosetia griegi) was found at the high temperature vent habitat. Their mean delta C-13 values were significantly lighter than conspecifics from a low temperature vent habitat within the same vent field, reflecting the incorporation of sulfide oxidizing bacteria into the biomass of the animals. The majority of fauna from the low temperature, near-HT, and non-vent habitats had isotopic signatures indicative of assimilation of photosynthetic material. However, we found remarkably diverse isotopic compositions among the fauna sampled here, with a small sub-set of fauna at each site possessing C and N isotopic signatures indicative of incorporation of chemo synthetic production. Moreover, when isotopic signatures of similar taxa were compared from the same sample, delta C-13 signatures suggested a high degree of trophic complexity can exist over relatively small spatial scales at vent habitats on the southern Mohn's Ridge. The high contribution of photosynthetic food material to faunal diets and variability in food types may result from the upper bathyal venting depth and sedimentary nature of the vents. We hypothesize that the upper bathyal depth of active venting may lead to iron enhancement of surface photosynthetic production, especially in high nutrient areas, which ultimately sinks to the seabed where it is incorporated by fauna around the vents.}

The convex hull area (TA) in a d13C\textendash d15N biplot has been used as a measure of isotopic niche width, but concerns exist over its dependence on sample size and associated difficulties in among-population comparisons. Recently a more robust method was proposed for estimating and comparing isotopic niche widths using standard ellipse areas (SEA), but this approach has yet to be tested with empirical stable isotope data. The two methods measure different kind of isotopic niche areas, but both are now widely used to characterise isotopic niche widths of populations. We used simulated data and an extensive empirical dataset from two fish populations to test the influence of sample size on the observed isotopic niche widths (TA and SEA). We resampled the original datasets to generate 5000 new samples for different numbers of observations from 5 to 80 to examine the statistical distributions of niche area estimates for increasing sample size. Our results illustrate how increasing sample size increased the observed TA; even sample sizes much higher than n = 30 did not improve the precision for the TA method. SEA was less sensitive to sample size, but the natural variation in our empirical fish d13C and d15N data still resulted in considerable uncertainty around the mean estimates of niche width, reducing the precision particularly with sample sizes n,30. These results confirm that the TA method is less appropriate for estimating population isotopic niche areas using small samples, especially when considerable population level isotope variation is expected. The results also indicate a need for caution when using SEA as a measure of trophic niche widths for consumers, particularly with low sample sizes and when the distribution and range for population isotope values are not known.},

Identifying the organisms or functional groups that are responsible for nutrient transfer, and quantifying their influence on ecosystem structure and carbon capture is an essential step for informed management of ecosystems in physically distant, but ecologically linked areas. Here, we combine natural abundance stable isotope tracers and survey data to show that mid-water and bentho-pelagic-feeding demersal fishes play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, bypassing the detrital particle flux and transferring carbon to deep long-term storage. Global peaks in biomass and diversity of fishes at mid-slope depths are explained by competitive release of the demersal fish predators of mid-water organisms, which in turn support benthic fish production. Over 50\% of the biomass of the demersal fish community at depths between 500 and 1800 m is supported by biological rather than detrital nutrient flux processes, and we estimate that bentho-pelagic fishes from the UK\textendash Irish continental slope capture and store a volume of carbon equivalent to over 1 million tonnes of CO               2               every year.},

Five of the most promising approaches to investigate the behavioral ecology are reviewed: (1) functional morphology, (2) field sampling, (3) acoustic tracking, (4) in-situ surveillance, and (5) ex-situ experimentation. Functional morphology, often a ``by-product'' of taxonomic and systematic studies, is strongly comparative and correlative, and serves to examine hypotheses on behavioral strategies. Field sampling with towed gear identifies vertical and horizontal distribution in the water column and deployments of stationary gear document aggregation and diversity patterns on or close to the seafloor. With acoustic instruments vertical migrations and segregation patterns can be tracked. In-situ observations with cameras and attraction devices or from underwater vehicles focus studies on behavior and habitat selection over small to large-scale intervals and distances, both vertically and horizontally. Ex-situ behavioral studies of deep-sea fishes brought to the surface have been conducted to a limited extent, mainly in unpressurized aquaria. An integrated approach which combines various methods would provide a more complete understanding of behavioral diversity and adaptations to environmental factors.},

We used continuous, year-long records from an upward-looking echosounder and broadband hydrophone at a cabled observatory off Central California, USA, to observe avoidance reactions by several groups of pelagic animals to the presence of their predators. As expected, vertical migration was ubiquitous, but we also observed behaviors at shorter and longer timescales that were best explained by fear of predation. The presence of foraging odontocetes induced immediate diving behavior in mesopelagic sound-scattering layers, and schools of epipelagic fishes induced similar reaction in layers of zooplankton and mesopelagic micronekton. At longer timescales, the presence of fish schools significantly deepened vertical migration, rearranging life throughout the water column. We argue that behavioral reactions to predation risk are common in the pelagic zone at a range of spatiotemporal scales and that our understanding of food webs and biogeochemical cycling in this immense biome will be incomplete unless we account for fear.},

  abstract = {Benthic\textendash pelagic coupling is an important process connecting species throughout the water column, particularly, in deep-sea systems where faunal assemblages can be dense if indirectly sustained by production from the above. Through stable isotope analyses, this study explored the sources of production, trophic structure, and benthopelagic coupling in two locations with contrasting oceanographic conditions from the western Mediterranean, in the Balearic (BsB) and the Algerian (AsB) sub-basins. The samples of 89 dominant species (23 decapods, 19 cephalopods, 33 fishes, among the other taxa), inhabiting the hyperbenthic and pelagic domains, from the shelf break (250 m), upper slope (650 m), and middle slope (850 m) were analyzed. Results suggested long food webs of approximately four trophic levels (TrLs) that were sustained by planktonic source material in shallower waters and degraded particulate organic matter of planktonic origin in deeper waters. Most of the collected species (70\%) occupied intermediate trophic positions between the 3rd and 4th TrLs. The species {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C values exhibited a broad range, consistent with the high diversity that might be attributed to the oligotrophic conditions. As the depth increased, stronger segregation occurred between the trophic groups, and spatial differences were found among consumers of the two locations. Species in the AsB always had consistently higher {$\delta$}15N values than in the BsB, which could possibly be attributed to the basal {$\delta$}15N that was present through the food web. Despite the contrasting basin characteristics, a similarly close bentho-pelagic coupling pattern was observed at both locations, except at the deepest ground, especially at the AsB, where the mean {$\delta$}13C values from the hyperbenthic and pelagic compartments were more distant. This could be related to the higher degree of reworking of organic matter in the AsB. Overall, these findings suggested the need for a depth-stratified approach to analyze deep-sea food webs in the study site in future studies.},

This study employs combined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) of the 18 most abundant western Mediterranean mesopelagic fishes to explore niche partitioning in this group. Sampling was conducted along the water column from the shelf and slope grounds of the Balearic Islands in two contrasting periods (late autumn and summer). Trophodynamics were explored at assemblage level and at inter- and intra-species resolutions respectively using Bayesian diet mixing models and size specific behaviour respectively. Seasonal {$\delta$}13C differences in near basal particulate organic matter (POM) and zooplankton fractions were almost directly replicated in higher fauna suggesting strong isotopic coupling between mesopelagic fishes and planktonic production. Despite reliance on similar basal production, species were segregated by trophic position with a graduation from 2.9 for the small Gonostomatidae Cyclothone braueri to 4.0 for the Myctophidae Lobianchia dofleini. Mixing model data reflected basic trophic position estimates with higher contributions of small fish and zooplankton/POM in higher and lower trophic level species respectively. Species could be categorized as showing preference for i) mesozooplankton/POM as for C. braueri, (in the lower TrL), ii) euphausiids and fish prey as for L. dofleini and the near bottom Lampanyctus crocodilus (in the upper TrL) and iii) mesozooplankton/euphausiids as Ceratoscopelus maderensis, Lampanyctus pusillus or the migrating L. crocodilus. There was little evidence of size based inter-population trophodynamics, with size-isotope trends explained by co-varying lipid content.},

  abstract = {Definition of biogeographic provinces, patterns of species distributions on local and regional scales, species richness, and relative abundances are all basic ecological measures, yet they are largely unknown for deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. Without an appreciation of biogeographic and biodiversity patterns, it is difficult to understand the evolutionary and ecological processes that underlie species distributions. To begin to address these issues, species composition, species richness, diversity, abundance, and recruitment patterns were studied within mussel beds at 3 remote hydrothermal fields on the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR). Two closely spaced fields (within 1 km) were hydrothermally active and shared the most abundant taxa, The mussel bed communities at these fields could be differentiated primarily by the relative abundances of species rather than by species composition. A third field was in a waning stage of hydrothermal activity. Productivity, biomass, and abundance of invertebrates associated with mussel beds at this third field were low, and the species list was a small subset of that found at the active fields, subsidized by several nonvent deep-sea taxa. Based on abundances of smallest size classes, recruitment of mussels and of several other dominant invertebrate species was high at the active sites. At the waning vent field, no recruitment was observed, except within the population of ophiuroids. Most of the species found within the SEPR mussel beds belong to species previously described from vent sites north of the equator, indicating that there is a single hydrothermal biogeographic province extending along the East Pacific Rise for more than 30 degrees of latitude. There were no shared species between SEPR mussel beds and a Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) vent mussel bed and species richness was more than twice as high at the active SEPR mussel beds than at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge mussel beds. As biogeographic provinces are defined and robust measures of species diversity accumulate for vent habitats on the East Pacific Rise and Mid-Atlantic Ridge, vent ecologists will be able to place the biogeography and biodiversity of vent faunas within the context of the regional and global biogeographic and diversity patterns observed in terrestrial and other marine ecosystems.},

Using replicate sampling, we examine species richness, diversity, evenness, and composition within mussel beds at the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and we compare these measures to those found at intertidal mussel beds along the south-central Alaskan coast using similar sampling efforts. The number of species found at the vent mussel beds is less than half that of the intertidal mussel beds. From calculations of diversity and evenness indices, we find that the lower diversity of the vent mussel beds is a reflection of a reduced number of rare species found there compared to intertidal mussel beds. In contrast to relatively even distributions of deep-sea soft-sediment (non-vent) communities, both vent and intertidal mussel beds share the attribute of very uneven distributions, with a large number of individuals found in a small number of species. Based on comparisons of the Shannon diversity index (H) within vent mussel beds and in a variety of other marine environments, we find that diversity at vent mussel beds is low, but no lower than the diversity measured in certain shallow-water environments. We hypothesize that diversity within the Lucky Strike mussel beds, located on a slow-spreading ridge where the spacing between vents is large, represents the low extreme of diversity at hydrothermal vents. We expect higher diversity at mussel beds on fast-spreading ridges (e.g., on the East Pacific Rise).},

A classification tree produced splits with longitude and sea surface salinity (SSS), thereby separating 3 geographically and oceanographically distinct regions of the ETP (offshore, nearshore, and intermediate), where diet was similar among the 3 species. Myctophids consumed, primarily, ostracods offshore (76.4\% mean percentage by number [MNi]), euphausiids nearshore (45.0\%), and copepods (66.6\%) in the intermediate region. The offshore region was characterized by a greater abundance of ostracods in the zooplankton community (17.5\% by number) and within a deep mixed-layer depth (MLD) (mean 52.6 m, max 93.0 m). SSS was low in the nearshore region ({$<$}32.9 psu) and the MLD was shallow. The intermediate region represented a transition zone between the oceanographic condition of the offshore and nearshore regions. Our results indicate that these 3 myctophid species share a similar regional diet that is strongly influenced by longitude, ostracod availability, SSS, and MLD.},

  abstract = {Manganese nodules provide an important habitat for sessile benthic organisms, many of them novel foraminifera, in the abyssal Pacific. The surface texture and microhabitat heterogeneity of nodules may play a significant role in structuring these communities. We analyzed the distribution of foraminiferal species on 20 nodules collected using either a USNEL box corer or the Nautile submersible sampling tool at a 5000-m-deep site in the Tropical North Pacific. The nodules had an upper region characterized by two microhabitats, namely raised surfaces and intervening depressed surfaces. The more or less vertical sides of the nodules were regarded as a third microhabitat. The upper region had a predominantly smooth texture while the sides had a rough texture. We tested whether the percent cover of each of the 34 species examined was distributed evenly over the three microhabitats and the two surface textures (smooth vs rough). More than half (20 out of 34) of species covered a greater area on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, while one-third of the species (12 out of 34) occurred more on raised microhabitats than on depressed surfaces and nodule sides. These two results are closely interrelated, since 78\% of the raised surfaces were characterized by a smooth texture. The nodule-encrusting species were feeding either on suspended particles or on particles deposited on the nodule surfaces. Because most species had a mat-like or domed morphology, we suspect that nodule surface feeding was more prevalent. Current flow, which transports propagules and particulate food, may be the main environmental factor explaining the observed faunal distributions, as it is in the case of other hard-substrate assemblages.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

This strain, which can be assigned to the genus Alteromonas on the basis of its G+C content and phenotypical features, produced large amounts of an acidic polysaccharide in batch cultures. The polysaccharide was excreted during the stationary phase of growth and contained glucose, galactose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, and 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethilidene)-galactose as major components. This polysaccharide was a polyelectrolyte, and the viscosity of its solutions depended on the ionic strength. The decrease in viscosity with increasing NaCl concentrations and the effect of Ca2+ in decreasing the viscosity at low Ca2+ concentrations support a model in which the polysaccharide carries anionic groups. However, an unusual behavior was observed at higher concentrations and could be related to intermolecular interactions involving Ca2+ ions.}

We used baseline-corrected stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) of 63 invertebrate and fish to investigate food web structure across a continental shelf gradient\textemdash the Celtic Sea Shelf in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Hierarchical clustering on {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N showed that the shelf food web is characterized by four trophic levels with trophic groups spread across pelagic and benthic trophic pathways. Four biomass-weighted isotopic diversity metrics provided indicators on the status of the system, showing a relatively complex food web with high trophic redundancy at intermediate trophic levels suggesting resilience to disturbances. Two sets of statistical models, at the community scale and for each trophic group, identified five distinct trophic assemblages associated with different chlorophyll a concentrations, water depth, and bottom temperature. A cold, vertically mixed-water assemblage over the outer shelf comprised the largest habitat and most diverse assemblage, highlighting the importance of cold productive conditions in the Celtic Sea. Trophic group model results were used to generate spatial area predictions to compare functioning of groups using isotopic overlap (similarity and nestedness) metrics. Isotopic niche area was larger (spanning two trophic levels) in shallow habitats, but not in habitats underlying high primary production or nutrient-rich water masses, suggesting stronger benthic-pelagic trophic coupling in inner shelf habitats. Results suggest that depth and intensity of pelagic production are major drivers of trophic structure and functioning of Celtic Sea communities.},

M. asperum fed mainly on appendicularians, M. nitidulum on copepods and amphipods, S. evermanni on euphausiids and C. brevirostris on pteropods. They also had speciesspecific peak feeding hours, demonstrated by the different hours during which each species had the greatest wet weight of stomach contents (percentage of body weight): 24:00 to 01:00 h (5.1\%) and 02:00 to 03:00 h (4.0\%) for M. asperum; 03:00 to 04:00 h (7.3\%) for M. nitidulum; 04:00 to 05:00 h (3.9\%) for S. evermanni; and 20:00 to 21:00 h, 22:00 to 23:00 h and 04:00 to 05:00 h (4.6, 5.3 and 3.8\%, respectively) for C. brevirostris.

During six pelagic surveys in the Canarian archipelago, Eastern Central Atlantic, over 65,000 fishes belonging to 211 species were collected at depths between 8 and 1035 m. The mesopelagic families of the lanternfishes (Myctophidae) and the bristlemouths (Gonostomatidae) accounted for about 50\% of all specimens. By multivariate classification and ordination methods four different assemblages associated with mesopelagic, epipelagic\'A oceanic or coastal habitats could be identified. Two of these assemblages were coastal, differing in the proportion of meso- and epipelagic species. These data indicate intense horizontal migrations of mesopelagic fishes (mainly Myctophidae) into the neritic realm and increased interactions between coastal and oceanic habitats. Alpha diversity indices were higher and dominance was lower in oceanic habitats compared to the coastal realm. No marked differences among oceanographically similar areas of the entire archipelago were found. Beta diversity as a measure of similarity among sites or samples revealed variabilities between areas south of Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura islands. A considerable heterogeneity in species distribution was found off SE Fuerteventura in an area with high hydrographic variability. Therefore, both topography and hydrography are important factors influencing the distribution and abundance of pelagic fishes in this oceanic archipelago.},

Changes in depth distribution and diel vertical migration with growth were evident for all 3 species. The size of S. leucopsams increased markedly with depth both at 0 to 90m at night and 250 to 500 m during the day. Larger D. theta were also found deeper during the day (between 250 and 450 m), but neither 1). theta nor T. crenularis demonstrated size segregation in the upper 90 m at night. Large D. theta and small T. crenularis did not appear to migrate into surface waters at night. Age-Group O (15 to 20 mm) S. leucopsarus were most abundant in deep water (400 to 480 m) in the daytime and did not migrate into near-surface waters at night. Age-Group I (30 to 40 mm) S. leucopsarus were common at about 300 m by day and within the upper 30 m at night. Age-Group II-III (50 to 60 mm) apparently followed the evening ascent of AgeGroup I fish and most resided at 75 to 90 m at night, beneath Age-Group I fish. Age-Group III+ fish (70 to 80 mm) were associated with Age-Group O at 400 to 480 m by day and usually did not migrate above 200 m at night. The size structure of S. leucopsarus differed among the nets of a single tow at one depth, or between two tows that fished the same depths on successive nights, indicating horizontal patchiness in age structure. D. theta demonstrated low within-tow variability in size composition which indicated a spatially more uniform age structure on a scale of kilometers. The size structures of these 3 lanternfishes were different in the same area and the same season during two different years, suggesting variable survival of year classes or horizontal patchiness of age composition in the area sampled.},

The two dominant seamount-associated micronekton at Southeast (SE) Hancock Seamount on the northern Hawaiian Ridge are the sternopthychid fish Maurolicus muelleri and the lophogastrid mysid Gnathophausia longispina. Distribution patterns for both species, based on midwater trawl and acoustic data, were compared with acoustic Doppler current profiler-measured ocean currents during four research cruises in 1987 and 1988. Populations of both species migrated above the seamount nightly. The distributions of these two species over the seamount were analyzed through acoustic surveys over the seamount flanks and summit. Differences between distributions in the first and second halves of the night were regulated by a combination of behavioral and physical processes. Ocean currents affected the localized nighttime aggregations over different regions of the summit within and between cruises. Currents over the summit had the potential to advect animals an average of 6 \textendash{} 7 km per night during the first two cruises and about 2 km per night during the last two cruises. Net and acoustic results indicated that G. longispina and M. muelleri were displaced to the downstream side of the summit through the night, but the distances of displacement were less than would have been predicted by advection alone.},

There are major uncertainties regarding their trophodynamics and their overall contribution to the broader Southern Ocean food web. This study aimed to investigate the trophic role of mesopelagic fish in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau, an area of known importance to an abundant and diverse community of marine predators. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to quantify the isotopic niches of key mesopelagic fish species (six from the family Myctophidae, and one from Bathylagidae), and assessed variation along the {$\delta$}15N (resource use) and {$\delta$}13C (carbon source) axes between species. The assemblage of key mesopelagic fish occupied similar isotopic niche space with overlap among species in both {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values. Baseline corrected {$\delta$}15N values provided evidence of latitudinal trends in trophic position (TP). Trophic position estimates of taxa in the southern region of our study area spanned slightly less than 1 TP (mean TP 2.9\textendash 3.7); and 1 TP in the northern region (mean TP 3.2\textendash 4.2). We found evidence of trophic partitioning between species with differences in niche utilization (resource or habitat use). Factors reducing trophic competition include the relative importance of Euphausia superba as a prey item, vertical distribution of consumer and prey, and migratory behaviours. Size-based trophic structuring between species was evident with larger species displaying higher average {$\delta$}15N values compared to smaller species. However, fish standard length explained little of the variation in {$\delta$}15N values at the species level, suggesting within species changes in trophic position with body size is not a predominant driver of trophic structure in our study region. Overall, our analysis demonstrated the structural complexity and spatial variation of the food web in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau.},

The assemblage of key mesopelagic fish occupied similar isotopic niche space with overlap among species in both {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values. However, there were areas of non-overlapping isotopic niche space between species providing evidence of niche partitioning most likely driven by interspecific differences in diet and body size. At the community level, fish standard length was positively correlated with {$\delta$}15N suggesting size-related differences in diet between species. However, within-species relationships between fish standard length and {$\delta$}15N were weak. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that while there is a degree of trophic diversity among the taxa examined, this assemblage comprises a single energy pathway, which is informative for overall understanding of food-web architecture as well as development of trophically orientated ecosystem model for this region.},

In the Gulf of Mexico, ecosystem models are applied to neritic systems, but less focus has been placed on the oceanic domain. Since 2011, severe declines have been observed in many micronekton groups that occupy the mesopelagic zone (200 \textendash{} 1000 m depth). Here we present an ecosystem model for the oceanic northern Gulf of Mexico for the year 2011, simulate that model according to micronekton trends through 2018, and quantify the top-down and bottom-up impacts that each functional group has on one another. These trends were examined to determine whether interactions between the two groups have changed directionally over time. In 2011, zooplankton (trophic level =2) occupied greater than one-third of the total metazoan biomass, and also 40\% of the total energy throughput ascended to higher trophic levels in the system. Of the 1849 possible functional group interactions (most of which are indirect), approximately 27\% showed significant changes between 2011 and 2018, which were related to shifts in biomass and diet throughout the simulation. Direct top-down in\- teractions changed more frequently than other types of trophic relationships. The frequency of direct changes that occurred in the simulation was not observed evenly among all functional groups, as opposed to indirect interactions. These changes between functional group interactions can be used to further examine potential shifts in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems under various forcing scenarios.},

The deep ocean, lacking light and in situ photosynthetic primary production, is an ideal model system to test the effects of temperature changes on biodiversity. Here we synthesize current knowledge on temperature\textendash diversity relationships in the deep sea. Our results from both present and past deep-sea assemblages suggest that, when a wide range of deep-sea bottom-water temperatures is considered, a unimodal relationship exists between temperature and diversity (that may be right skewed). It is possible that temperature is important only when at relatively high and low levels but does not play a major role in the intermediate temperature range. Possible mechanisms explaining the temperature\textendash biodiversity relationship include the physiological-tolerance hypothesis, the metabolic hypothesis, island biogeography theory, or some combination of these. The possible unimodal relationship discussed here may allow us to identify tipping points at which on-going global change and deep-water warming may increase or decrease deep-sea biodiversity. Predicted changes in deep-sea temperatures due to human-induced climate change may have more adverse consequences than expected considering the sensitivity of deep-sea ecosystems to temperature changes.},

We begin with a review of methodologies used to advance our understanding of the trophodynamics of marine top predators, particularly in relation to climate change. We then explore how these developments are informing our understanding of the major trophic groups in food webs leading to, and including, marine top predators. We examine through specific examples how the impacts of ocean warming may affect pelagic food web relationships from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. We examine the potential, in the absence of long-term data sets, of using large-scale spatial studies to examine how potential changes in biological oceanography could impact the biomass and composition of prey species, particularly the role of phytoplankton size spectra. We focus on examples from regions where biotic change with respect to climate change is likely. In particular, we detail the effects of climate change on oceanographic and bathymetric ``hotspots'' and provide the example involving seabirds in the Benguela Current system. We end by urging the development of international collaborations and databases to facilitate comprehensive ocean-scale understanding of climate impacts on marine top predators.},

  abstract = {Extreme marine environments cover more than 50\% of the Earth's surface and offer many opportunities for investigating the biological responses and adaptations of organisms to stressful life conditions. Extreme marine environments are sometimes associated with ephemeral and unstable ecosystems, but can host abundant, often endemic and well-adapted meiofaunal species. In this review, we present an integrated view of the biodiversity, ecology and physiological responses of marine meiofauna inhabiting several extreme marine environments (mangroves, submarine caves, Polar ecosystems, hypersaline areas, hypoxic/anoxic environments, hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, carcasses/sunken woods, deep-sea canyons, deep hypersaline anoxic basins [DHABs] and hadal zones). Foraminiferans, nematodes and copepods are abundant in almost all of these habitats and are dominant in deep-sea ecosystems. The presence and dominance of some other taxa that are normally less common may be typical of certain extreme conditions. Kinorhynchs are particularly well adapted to cold seeps and other environments that experience drastic changes in salinity, rotifers are well represented in polar ecosystems and loriciferans seem to be the only metazoan able to survive multiple stressors in DHABs. As well as natural processes, human activities may generate stressful conditions, including deoxygenation, acidification and rises in temperature. The behaviour and physiology of different meiofaunal taxa, such as some foraminiferans, nematode and copepod species, can provide vital information on how organisms may respond to these challenges and can provide a warning signal of anthropogenic impacts. From an evolutionary perspective, the discovery of new meiofauna taxa from extreme environments very often sheds light on phylogenetic relationships, while understanding how meiofaunal organisms are able to survive or even flourish in these conditions can explain evolutionary pathways. Finally, there are multiple potential economic benefits to be gained from ecological, biological, physiological and evolutionary studies of meiofauna in extreme environments. Despite all the advantages offered by meiofauna studies from extreme environments, there is still an urgent need to foster meiofauna research in terms of composition, ecology, biology and physiology focusing on extreme environments.},

  abstract = {Despite their ubiquitous distribution in tectonically active coastal zones, shallow-water vents have been much less explored than deep-sea vents in terms of biodiversity and adaptations to extreme conditions. We investigated the meiofaunal biodiversity and environmental variables at distances of 10, 100 and 200 cm from a shallow-water hydrothermal vent in the equatorial Pacific (Sulawesi, Indonesia). Meiofaunal abundance and the richness of higher taxa increased from the site of fluid-vent emission (where temperatures of the fluids and sediments reached approximately 90 degrees C) to the control sediments (200 cm from the vent, with no sign of effects from the vent fluids). Nematode species richness was also high in the intermediate station, where bottom sediment temperature reached 55 degrees C. These data suggest that some nematode species were able to survive in conditions typically hostile to metazoan life. Gas emissions also influenced the biochemical composition of the sediment organic matter in proximity to the vent and favoured the growth of a large photo- and/or chemo-autotrophic prokaryotic biomass. This biomass represented a potentially important. food source for predator/omnivore nematodes and influenced the trophic structure of benthic assemblages. Since the metazoan species found in proximity to the vent were a subset of those inhabiting control sediments, but were characterised by lower abundances, it might be hypothesized that the populations close to the vent are the result of colonization from adjacent areas.}

  abstract = {Two surveys using a combination of midwater trawl and acoustics were undertaken in October 2014 and June 2015 to investigate species composition and biomass density of mesopelagic nekton over the continental slope of the South China Sea (CSSCS). In two surveys, diversity and dominant species of nektons (Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes and Cephalopoda) showed obviously diel and depth\textendash dependent difference. In 2014, in general species richness and diversity of nektons in the 0\textendash 100 m at night were greater than that in the 350\textendash 650 m during the day and 350\textendash 650 m at night. In Jun. 2015, species richness and diversity of nektons in the 350\textendash 650 m during the day were much greater than that in the 350\textendash 650 m at night and 0\textendash 100 m at night.},

  abstract = {Investigations on the functional niche of organisms have primarily focused on differences among species and tended to neglect the potential effects of intraspecific variability despite the fact that its potential ecological and evolutionary importance is now widely recognized. In this study, we measured the distribution of functional traits in an entire population of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variability in functional traits and niche (size, position, and overlap) between age classes. Stable isotope analyses (d13C and d15N) were also used to determine the association between individual trophic ecology and intraspecific functional trait variability. We observed that functional traits were highly variable within the population (mean coefficient variation: 15.62\% \AE{} 1.78\% SE) and predominantly different between age classes. In addition, functional and trophic niche overlap between age classes was extremely low. Differences in functional niche between age classes were associated with strong changes in trophic niche occurring during ontogeny while, within age classes, differences among individuals were likely driven by trophic specialization. Each age class filled only a small portion of the total functional niche of the population and age classes occupied distinct portions in the functional space, indicating the existence of ontogenetic specialists with different functional roles within the population. The high amplitude of intraspecific variability in functional traits and differences in functional niche position among individuals reported here supports the recent claims for an individualbased approach in functional ecology.},
