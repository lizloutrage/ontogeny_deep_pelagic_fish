Two different datasets were used to study ontogenetic changes in deep-sea pelagic fish species from the Bay of Biscay :

- __The trawling (first) dataset__: included all data collected by trawls (i.e. number of individuals per species per sampling depth and total body length of each individual; n = 4165). __DOI :__ 

- To study the trophic aspects of ontogeny, muscle sampling was performed on 12 species of the trawling dataset to access the$\delta$<sup>15</sup>N values of individuals (n = 682). This constituted the __isotopic (second) dataset__. The size measured for the individuals sampled for the isotopic dataset was the standard length. __DOI :__

## Trawling data: 
  - [`data/trawling_dataset.csv`]: contains data on the size (total length in cm) of the sampled individuals and the sampling depth (m)

## Isotopie data:
  - [`data/ontogeny_isotopy_data.csv`]: contains data on the $\delta$<sup>15</sup>N values (â€°) of each individual sampled, as well as their size (standard length in cm) and the trawling depth (m).
