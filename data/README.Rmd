The two datasets used will soon be available from the PANGAEA directory. 

Two different datasets were used to study ontogenetic changes in deep-sea pelagic fish species from the Bay of Biscay. The trawling (first) dataset included all data collected by trawls (i.e. number of individuals per species per sampling depth and total body length of each individual; n = 4165). To study the trophic aspects of ontogeny, muscle sampling was performed on 12 species of the trawling dataset to access the$\delta$<sup>15</sup>N values of individuals (n = 682). This constituted the isotopic (second) dataset. The size measured for the individuals sampled for the isotopic dataset was the standard length.

## Trawling data: 
  - [`data/trawling_dataset.csv`]: contains data on the size (total length in cm) of the sampled individuals and the sampling depth (m)

## Isotopie data:
  - [`data/ontogeny_isotopy_data.csv`]: contains data on the $\delta$<sup>15</sup>N values (â€°) of each individual sampled, as well as their size (standard length in cm) and the trawling depth (m).
