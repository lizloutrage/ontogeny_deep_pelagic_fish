Two different datasets were used to study ontogenetic changes in deep-pelagic fish species from the Bay of Biscay :

## Trawling data: 
  - [`data/trawling_dataset.csv`]: included all data collected by trawls (i.e. number of individuals per species per sampling depth and total body length of each individual; n = 4165). __DOI :https://doi.org/10.48579/PRO/O5QHTE __ 

## Isotopie data:
  - [`data/ontogeny_isotopy_data.csv`]: To study the trophic aspects of ontogeny, muscle sampling was performed on 12 species of the trawling dataset to access the$\delta$<sup>15</sup>N values of individuals (n = 682). This constituted the __isotopic (second) dataset__. The size measured for the individuals sampled for the isotopic dataset was the standard length. __DOI : https://doi.org/10.48579/PRO/QE2VWQ  __
